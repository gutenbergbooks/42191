<h1>The Motorboat Boys Down
the Danube</h1>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>FOUR CHUMS ABROAD</small></h2>


<p>“So this is the famous Budapest, is it, the
twin cities of the blue Danube we’ve been hearing
so much about?”</p>

<p>“Huh! doesn’t strike me as so very much of
a wonderful place. When you come to think of
it, little old New York and Brooklyn can beat
it all hollow so far as bustle and business go;
even Chicago would run it a hot race.”</p>

<p>“Now that’s just like you, George Rollins,
always ready to find fault, and throw cold
water on everything. No wonder they’ve
called you ‘Doubting George’ this long time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
back. There’s always a flaw somewhere, you
believe, and so you look for it right along.”</p>

<p>“Between you and me, Buster, I don’t think
he ever will be cured of that nasty habit. Why
can’t he see the bright side of things once in a
while, and be an optimist, like our chum and
commodore, Jack Stormways?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you ought to know by this time, Josh,
a leopard can’t change its spots. I reckon our
friend George here has spasms of reform once
in just so often; but his weakness is ground in,
and his resolves collapse, so he goes back to his
old ways again.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say, Buster? Kindly take pity
on my ignorance and tell me what there is so
wonderful about this old Hungarian capital
perched on the banks of the Danube and joined
by bridges? I’m willing to have the scales
taken from my eyes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, first there’s the river itself, not
dirty water like most of our streams over in
the States, but clear, and almost the color of
the blue sky overhead.”</p>

<p>“Sounds fine, Buster. Good for you; go
ahead and open his blind eyes some more. It
was always George’s way to have his nose
down over the engine of his Wireless motorboat,
and never see a blessed thing around him.
Hit him again for his mother, Buster.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then look at the clear atmosphere; the picturesque
buildings hanging over the river
banks; the queer shaped boats running back
and forth; the remarkable costumes of these
Magyars; and last, but far from least, that
glorious August sunset painting the little
clouds in the west crimson and green and gold.
I tell you it’s a scream of a place, if you’ve got
any eyes in your head.”</p>

<p>“Buster, you’re a wonder at word painting,
though I reckon you cribbed some of that stuff
from the guide book. What do you say to it
now, old If and But and Maybe?”</p>

<p>“Why, it looks good enough, I own up, fellows,
but chances are all this is only on the surface.
Scratch the veneer off when you go
ashore to-morrow, and prowl around, and
you’ll find Budapest just as rotten at the core
as Chicago.”</p>

<p>“Don’t waste any more words on the
growler, Buster. There’s such a thing as casting
pearls before swine, you know&mdash;not saying
that our chum here is really and truly a <em>hog</em>;
but all the same he grunts like one. Let’s talk
about our own affairs.”</p>

<p>“Wonder if Jack will fetch a sheaf of letters
back from the postoffice? And say, I’m just a
little mite anxious to learn how that spat between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Serbia and Austria is going to turn
out.”</p>

<p>“All of us are, Buster, and have been ever
since we read how the Grand Duke who was
the latest heir to the Austrian throne after
Francis Joseph was murdered with his wife by
some Serbian hothead conspirators.”</p>

<p>“Oh, as far as that goes, Josh, I figure that
the game little bantam will have to take water
and back down, after all this strutting around,
just to show that Serbians have pluck.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure of that, fellows,” put in
George; “you mustn’t forget that Russia, yes,
and France, too, are back of Serbia. There
may be something more come out of this rattling
of sabres in their scabbards than only a
tempest in a teapot.”</p>

<p>“Then it would be Russia and France
against the two Teuton States,” remarked the
boy answering to the suggestive name of Buster;
“and knowing how the Kaiser has been
getting his country ready for a scrap this long
while, I’d bet on them to turn the trick.”</p>

<p>George, despite his failings, seemed to have
read up on the matter and be pretty well
posted on facts.</p>

<p>“But there’s always a big chance it wouldn’t
stop there,” he announced, with an air of importance;
“other countries would sooner or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
later be drawn into the scramble, because
everybody believes there’s going to be an
Armageddon or great world war before the
era of peace finally comes along.”</p>

<p>“Just what do you mean?” demanded Josh.</p>

<p>“There’s Great Britain, for instance; she’s
bound to France in some way, and may have
to shy her castor into the ring. Then her ally
in the East, Japan, may choose to knock out
Germany’s holding in China, just to oblige.
Besides, Italy must show her hand, and for one
I can’t believe she’ll stand for her old enemy,
Austria. And last, but not least, there’s Turkey,
hand in glove with Germany, besides all
those scrappy little Balkan States, from
Greece to Bulgaria and Rumania, who will
fight just as they think their interests lie.”</p>

<p>“Whee! but it would be a grand smash-up if
all that comes off!” ejaculated Buster. “I’d
sure hate to pay the bills. It’d take me some
time to get enough of the long green together
I sure reckon.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me it’s high time for Jack to be
showing up,” ventured Josh. “I hope he
hasn’t run up against any trouble, being unable
to speak even ten words of German, while
the Magyar tongue is a sealed book to him.”</p>

<p>“I hinted to Jack that perhaps I’d better be
the one to go,” said George, modestly, “because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
I know German fairly well; but he only
laughed, and said there were lots of ways of
communicating with a Hungarian as long as
both parties had their hands to use and could
wink and nod.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, while we’re waiting for him here
on our old powerboat that we chartered,” said
Buster, with a resigned air, “I’m going to take
time to make out a list of groceries we want to
lay in while we’re at the capital. Goodness
knows if we’ll have a half-way decent chance
to buy anything worth eating again before we
strike the Serbian border, and then push on
through Rumania to the Black Sea.”</p>

<p>George and Josh also sought comfortable
seats where they could lounge and watch in a
lazy fashion the bustling scene around them;
for there were dozens of quaint sights to be
seen if one only used his eyes.</p>

<p>While the three lads are thus employed,
awaiting the coming of their comrade who had
gone to get their mail at the general postoffice,
a few words of explanation concerning them
may not come amiss.</p>

<p>These four boys belonged to a motorboat
club over in the Middle West, their home being
on the upper Mississippi River. There were
two other members, who had not made the trip
abroad, by name Herb Dickson and Jimmy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Brannagan, the latter a ward of Jack Stormways’
father.</p>

<p>Buster, of course, had another name, which
was Nicholas Longfellow. Nature had in a
way played a sad joke on the boy, for, while
a Longfellow by family relation, he was also
pudgy and fat, always wheezing when exerting
himself, but as jolly as could be, full of good
nature, and willing to go to any trouble to help
a friend, yes, or even an enemy.</p>

<p>Josh Purdue had a strain of the Yankee in
him, for he was as sharp as a steel trap, though
perfectly honest. As an all-round comrade
Josh could not very well be excelled.</p>

<p>George Rollins was a good-enough chap too,
though he complained at times, and was so inclined
to want to be shown that his friends had
dubbed him “Old Missouri” and “Doubting
George.”</p>

<p>These six boys had gone through a good
many lively times together, as they possessed
three motorboats of different models, called
the Wireless, a cracky craft built for racing,
and which gave George, the skipper, much
trouble; the Tramp, which Jack commanded;
and the beamy Comfort, run by Herb Dickson.</p>

<p>It would be utterly impossible for us to undertake
to mention a tithe of their interesting
and thrilling escapades while cruising in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
boats. If the reader who has made their acquaintance
for the first time in this volume
desires to know more about these happenings,
he is referred to the six earlier books in the
Motorboat Boys’ Series, all of which can be
easily procured.</p>

<p>As to just how the interesting quartette of
wide-awake American boys came to be running
down the historical Danube River in the late
summer of nineteen-fourteen, that can be easily
explained.</p>

<p>Some of their parents were well-to-do, and
as school would not begin this year until some
time in October or November, it was at first
suggested in a spirit of fun, and then debated
as an actual possibility, that they coax their
folks to let them go abroad for a season.</p>

<p>Needless to say that as the lads had considerable
money in the treasury, thanks to their
having been instrumental in capturing some
bold bank robbers who had run away with the
funds of an institution, they were finally able
to gain their folks’ consent.</p>

<p>Then came the question of what they would
like to do most of all. By this time they had
come to be such cruisers that they could not
bear the thought of following in the footsteps
of the general run of European tourists. Any
one could read all about the cities in the magazine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
accounts, as well as the many books of foreign
travel.</p>

<p>It was Jack who made a startling proposition
that caught the fancy of the other three
from the first.</p>

<p>He had lately been reading an account of a
canoe trip made by an English gentleman all
the way down the Danube from its source in
Germany not far from the Rhine, through
Austria-Hungary, along the Serbian border,
and then through Rumania until he finally
reached the Black Sea, and brought up at Constantinople.</p>

<p>The account was so vividly written up that
it appealed strongly to Jack, and his proposition
was that they make their way to some
place further down the beautiful river than his
starting point, charter some kind of a motorboat,
and continue the voyage. They could
thus get to the Turkish capital in good time
after a most interesting trip, take a steamer to
London, and come home in that way.</p>

<p>Well, the more they talked it over the
stronger grew the inclination to enjoy a water
voyage through a most interesting country, the
praises of which they had seen sung in many
an account they managed to unearth at the
library.</p>

<p>Eventually this was just what the daring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
quartette had done. They were lucky enough
to get hold of a pretty fair powerboat that
would accommodate four sleepers with some
crowding. This they had fitted up to suit
themselves, for long experience in camping out
had made them wise in many particulars.
And, Buster considered this the most important
part of the whole business, they had found
a little kerosene blue-flame stove something
like those they owned at home, upon which
many of their future meals were likely to be
cooked.</p>

<p>The party had only been a short time on the
way when they brought up at the Hungarian
capital, where it was planned to spend a couple
of days prying around; for they had reason to
believe they would run across no large city
save Belgrade in Serbia until they crossed the
Black Sea and came to Constantinople.</p>

<p>As often happens, the best laid plans often
go astray, and, looking back to former scenes,
the four chums could pick out several other instances
when this had happened to them.</p>

<p>Buster had just finished his long list of eatables,
in which he jotted down everything that
appealed to his voracious appetite, when Josh
was heard saying he had glimpsed Jack coming.
All of them therefore jumped up to greet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the bearer of the mailbag, being greatly interested
in news from the home folks.</p>

<p>“Something has happened, as sure as you
live!” exclaimed Josh as the fourth member
of the little party drew closer; “look at Jack’s
face, will you? He couldn’t be more solemn if
he had been told he was going to be hung to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“No bad news from across the sea, I hope,
Jack?” faltered Buster.</p>

<p>Jack Stormways, who was a resolute looking
young fellow, a born leader among boys, shook
his head and allowed a faint smile to steal
across his sober countenance.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to say it isn’t that, fellows,” he
told them; “but all Budapest is in a frightful
uproar just now, and it’s a question if our
lovely voyage doesn’t come to a sudden end
right here.”</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar’s ghost! What’s happened
now, Jack?” cried Josh, looking alarmed.</p>

<p>“Only this, and you can guess what it means
in Europe,” Jack announced. “Germany declared
war on Russia last night, and her army
is said to be already marching into neutral
Belgium to strike France in the back, and take
Paris!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>THE NEWS OF WAR AT BUDAPEST</small></h2>


<p>When Jack made this astounding statement
the other three stared at him as though they
could hardly believe he was not joking. But
then Jack seldom attempted to play a practical
prank; besides, they could see that he was seriously
disposed, and evidently grappling with
one of the largest propositions that had ever
faced him.</p>

<p>“Then it means a world war has begun, does
it?” gasped Buster presently, when he could
catch his breath again.</p>

<p>“That’s what it’s bound to result in,” Jack
told him. “The cry of ‘wolf’ has been heard
for the last time, and now the beast has come!”</p>

<p>“But will Great Britain and all the other
nations jump in?” demanded George.</p>

<p>“Not jump in, but find themselves dragged
in, in spite of their horror of war. This thing
has been hanging fire a long while, but every
little while there would be signs of what lay
under the surface. Lots of people predicted it
was bound to come sooner or later, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
destinies of every world power would have to
be settled once and for all by the sword.”</p>

<p>“Then all other wars will be baby play beside
this one,” Josh declared, “with the wonderful
modern arms they’ve got. Millions of
men must be killed before the end comes, and
old Europe will never know herself, such great
changes in border lines are bound to take
place.”</p>

<p>“But what of us?” asked George.</p>

<p>“That’s what we’ve got to decide right
away,” Jack announced. “We live thousands
of miles away from the scene of hostilities, and
our neutral country may not be pulled into the
whirlpool; but here we are in Austria-Hungary
that is now in a state of war with Serbia,
Montenegro, Russia and France, with other
countries to hear from. What ought we do
about it?”</p>

<p>“Let’s tell the Kaiser we won’t stand for
any of this funny business,” Buster went on to
say, pretending to look very important, though
there was a quizzical gleam in his eyes at the
same time; “let him know he’s got to sheathe
that sword of his in double-quick time, or
America will get mad.”</p>

<p>“Much the Kaiser would care for a dozen
Americas,” jeered George. “Germany armed
can defy the whole world, and as for our great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
big country, we’re only a second China, don’t
you know&mdash;plenty of people, much talk, but
able to do next door to nothing.”</p>

<p>“I say it would be a beastly shame if we had
to quit now before hardly getting started,” asserted
Josh, indignantly.</p>

<p>“Go on, the rest of you, for I want to hear
everybody’s opinion,” urged Jack.</p>

<p>“But if the whole of Austria is on a war
footing, what chance would we have to continue
our lovely voyage?” George wanted to
know. “As like as not we’d be arrested, because
they’d call us spies trying to find a way
to invade the country through the back door.”</p>

<p>“One for keeping on, and another against
it, which is a stand-off,” remarked Jack; “how
about you, Buster?”</p>

<p>“Gee whilikens! I hardly know where I’m
at,” muttered the fat chum, rubbing the tip of
his nose in bewilderment; “fact is I’m about
ready to do whatever the rest of you say.”</p>

<p>“In other words, you’re on the fence, I take
it,” sneered George; “if there’s anything I
dislike it’s to run across a <em>jellyfish</em>, something
that has no opinions of its own. There, that’s
one for you fellows calling me swine. But
how about you, Jack? We ought to know
what you think about it all.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Josh eagerly, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
could see that their future movements were
likely to be controlled by whatever Jack said,
since with a tie his vote would be the deciding
factor.</p>

<p>“I’ll be frank with you fellows,” Jack continued
soberly. “We’ve gone to a whole lot of
trouble and expense to get started on this
cruise, and I hate like everything to give it up.”</p>

<p>“Hear! hear!” came from Josh, with a tinge
of growing triumph in his voice.</p>

<p>“When I think of all that we’d have to go
through with to get back to London the way we
came I feel like saying we ought to try and
keep right on down the river. The greatest
danger to us would come from approaching
the fighting region around Northern France
and Belgium.”</p>

<p>Even George seemed to be hanging on Jack’s
words as though, after all, his ideas of prudence
might be undergoing a change.</p>

<p>“We could go ashore right away,” Jack continued,
“and buy what stuff we need, for I see
Bumpus is holding a list in his hand, and we
know him well enough to feel sure he’s omitted
nothing worth while having.”</p>

<p>“That settles it, then,” burst out Josh.
“You hear, George, you’re outvoted three to
one. We go on our way, snapping our fingers
under the nose of every Magyar who feels like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
questioning our right to cruise down the beautiful
blue Danube.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, move we make it unanimous
then,” snapped George, which proved that,
after all, his objections could only have been
skin-deep, and were offered more in a spirit of
contrariness than seriously.</p>

<p>“Here are letters for every one,” remarked
Jack; “but if you take my advice you’ll keep
them until after we’ve had supper. There’s a
whole lot to be done before night settles down.”</p>

<p>“Jack, you’ve been ashore, and mebbe now
you happened to notice a good grocery store
where we could pick up what we need in the
line of grub,” and as he asked this Buster
waved his formidable list before him.</p>

<p>“It happens that I did just that same thing,
and, better still, the place is only a short distance
away from here. From the glance I took
at it I reckon we could get about everything we
want, provided we’re willing to take them in
the Hungarian style of putting up the packages.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” decided Buster, “so far as that goes,
a rose by any other name would smell just as
sweet. I’d be willing to forget the trade names
of the oatmeal, hominy, and such things I’m
used to seeing, if the contents of the packages
turned out to be as good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, Buster,” continued the other,
“suppose we start out right away and do our
shopping. I suppose if we buy for cash they’ll
send the things around here to this boat builder’s
wharf where we had permission to tie up
during our stay here.”</p>

<p>Everybody looked pleased. It was as if a
dreadful load had been suddenly lifted from
their hearts. They would never have been
fully satisfied to abandon their trip down the
Danube on such short notice. In times to come
they would very likely call themselves silly to
be frightened off so easily by what might turn
out to be only a shadow of coming trouble.</p>

<p>Buster proved himself willing enough by
scrambling ashore. In fact, when the question
of eating was concerned no one could ever accuse
the fat boy of shirking his duty; as Josh
said, “When the dinner horn blew Buster was
always Johnny-on-the-spot,” though truth to
tell the said Josh often ran a race with his comrade
at table.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you’ll be needing a German
scholar along with you to do the bargaining?”
suggested George pompously.</p>

<p>Buster chuckled at hearing that.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about us, George,” he advised
the other, “we can get through all right.
As long as I’ve got eyes and can <em>smell</em> things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
I reckon I’ll be able to pick out what we want
most. And money talks, George, better than
some people’s German.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, they say a prophet never is appreciated
in his own country,” sighed George;
“but all the same I’m going to practice up in
my German, because it may serve us well
sooner or later. If you fellows get pinched,
send us word and I’ll hurry around to the
police station to explain matters.”</p>

<p>“How kind you are, George; but I’m afraid
after they heard your fine German they’d put
<em>you</em> behind the bars for murdering the language.”</p>

<p>With that parting shot Buster hurried
away, leaving Josh shaking his sides with
laughter, for they did love to get a crack at
George, who was always complaining and
throwing cold water on every plan.</p>

<p>Jack led the way, for, having been already
over the ground, he could serve in the capacity
of pilot.</p>

<p>“Listen, Buster,” he said impressively as
they walked along toward the nearby street,
“from now on we want to let everybody know
that we’re American boys, and not English,
you understand.”</p>

<p>“What’s the idea, Jack? Up to now a lot of
people have taken us for English, and we’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
let it go at that without taking the bother to
explain, because there’s always been a warm
friendly feeling between the Austrians and the
English.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Buster, but if Great Britain
gets into this big scrap you can see that she’ll
be up against the soldiers of Austria-Hungary
as well as those of the Kaiser. So from now on
stand up for your colors. We’re Americans
every time, and don’t you forget it.”</p>

<p>Buster evidently saw the point, for he promised
to faithfully observe the counsel of his
mate, in whom he placed the utmost reliance.</p>

<p>They soon reached the store which Jack had
noticed. It was quite an extensive establishment,
and there could be little doubt but that
everything needful on Buster’s list might be
procured there. If some of the items chanced
to be lacking, their place could be filled with
others equally attractive, Jack felt sure.</p>

<p>By great good luck the proprietor could
speak and read English. This made it very
easy for the purchasers. He also promised to
have the goods delivered inside of an hour, and
said he knew the boatyard well.</p>

<p>When Jack went to pay for their purchases
he had only English money. He thought the
merchant looked at him a little more closely,
and considered that this was a very good opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to prove their nationality. So he
took out a letter he had just received, which
bore the home postmark across in America.
This he showed, as well as one Buster also produced,
as proof of his assertion that they were
Americans, and not English.</p>

<p>“Nothing like getting your hand in,” he
told Buster later on when they were making
their way back to where the boat was tied up.</p>

<p>“And come to think of it,” added the other
with sudden vehemence, “I believe I’ve got a
little silk edition of Old Glory stowed away
somewhere in my bundle. I just chucked the
same in, thinking we might want to fasten it to
our boat; but up to this minute it’s slipped my
mind. How’d it do to make use of it, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Splendid idea,” commented the other.</p>

<p>“As long as that waves in the breeze nobody
can mistake our nationality; even if George
keeps on trying to talk that silly German of
his. He makes such a mess of it that some of
these people may think we’re spies out to learn
all about the fortifications of the lower Danube.”</p>

<p>Upon their arrival at the boat the others
questioned them concerning the success of
their undertaking. Josh also wanted to know
if they had managed to pick up any further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
news concerning the great struggle that had
begun.</p>

<p>“We went after grub,” Buster told him severely,
“and that being the case, you needn’t
expect that we would waste our precious time
jabbering about a silly old war, would you?
If you do you’ve got another guess coming.
And say, we got everything on my list, would
you believe it, or something that was just as
good.”</p>

<p>“Huh! I can see why you’re grinning so
happily, Buster,” sneered George; “you’re
contemplating many a fine feed ahead.”</p>

<p>“We’re all in the same boat, George,” sang
out Buster blithely; “and when the tocsin calls
us to supper I notice that as a rule you’re
never hanging far in the rear. Considering
the difference in our heft, I take it I’ve got a
bird’s appetite compared with you and Josh
here&mdash;pound for pound.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s getting twilight, so suppose we
start in with that same supper,” Jack ventured
to say. “For one I’m willing to admit
that an afternoon humming down the river has
given me a ferocious appetite; and I’m not
ashamed to declare it, either.”</p>

<p>Buster needed no second invitation. Time
had been when the fat boy hardly knew how to
cook a rasher of bacon properly; but his love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of eating had inspired him to pick up fresh
knowledge, with the result that he now stood in
a class by himself.</p>

<p>Perhaps Josh and George, wishing to shirk
much of their share of the culinary operations,
flattered Buster more than was really necessary.
They imposed upon his good nature in
this way outrageously; but since the stout
youth seemed to really enjoy handling the
saucepans and skillet, Jack interposed no objections.</p>

<p>Supper was soon ready, though they had to
light the lanterns before they could sit down
at the little adjustable table, which, when not
in use, could be slung up against the wall of
the cabin and the space it occupied utilized as
sleeping quarters for one of the crew.</p>

<p>After that they sat around talking in low
tones and covering a wide range of subjects as
usual in their conversation, from the folks at
home, numerous former escapades that came
to mind, to the terrible conflict that apparently
promised to engulf the whole of Europe in its
thrall.</p>

<p>Then a vehicle came into the boatyard and
the stores were taken aboard. When they had
been stowed away in temporary places Jack
declared that he meant to open his letter from
home and enjoy the contents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, this reminded the others that they
too had news from those dear ones now so far
away, and for a long time the four sat there,
lost in contemplation of distant scenes brought
close to them by those envelopes and their contents.</p>

<p>Later on they lay down to secure what sleep
was possible. As a rule, after the first night
afloat all of them had little difficulty about
sleeping; but it seemed that on this occasion
they turned and tossed considerably more than
usual before settling down. Perchance it was
the thrilling news they had heard that afternoon
that made them so restless; or it may
have been a premonition of coming difficulties
that kept them awake; but morning came and
found them far from refreshed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>TAKING CHANCES</small></h2>


<p>“Better take a little turn ashore, Josh and
George, while I’m getting breakfast ready,”
advised Buster; “you’d hate to say you’d
passed through Budapest without even setting
foot in the city.”</p>

<p>“If you go, be careful not to get lost,” added
Jack, looking as though almost tempted to
veto the arrangement; but George proudly declared
he felt sure of being able to find his way
about.</p>

<p>“Don’t be more than half an hour at the
most, fellows,” sang out Buster after the
couple, and they waved their hands at him as
if they understood.</p>

<p>About the time breakfast was ready Jack
went ashore to look for the absent ones, but
there was as yet no sign of them. In fact, the
two who were left aboard had more than half
finished their meal and were becoming really
worried when the others made their appearance.</p>

<p>George looked a trifle chagrined, while Josh
was chuckling to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the joke? Tell us, Josh,” demanded
Buster.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, hurry up and give him the full
particulars,” sneered George, looking daggers
at his companion.</p>

<p>“Why, you see, George here tried some of
his German on a gendarme we happened to
meet,” explained Josh between gurgles. “Say,
you ought to have seen how surprised that cop
looked. I’m afraid George got his nouns
twisted and called him some sort of bad name.
Anyhow, he was for taking us to the lock-up;
but I managed to soothe him down some by
showing him my letters with the American
postmarks on them, and letting a silver coin
slip into his hand. But he shook his head and
looked as if he could eat poor George. All the
way back George has been racking his brain
trying to understand what it was he really
called that uniformed gendarme. I rather
think it stood for pig.”</p>

<p>“Well, let that rest, will you, Josh?”
growled George. “What I’m most interested
in just now is pig of another kind, for I see
Buster has fried some bacon for us. Mistakes
will happen in the best regulated families, they
say, and I own up I’m afraid I did get my
nouns slightly mixed.”</p>

<p>“Slightly!” echoed Josh, with a shrug of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
shoulders. “Well, if the boys could only have
seen how that big cop scowled at you they’d
have had a fit.”</p>

<p>As Josh was also hungry, he wasted no more
time in explanations, and so the incident was
forgotten for the present. Later on it would
doubtless give Josh occasion for considerable
additional merriment and be the cause for
more or less acrimonious conversation between
the pair.</p>

<p>While they were eating Jack proceeded to
settle with the owner of the boatyard for the
accommodations, for a bargain had been
struck with him. People over in old Europe
are not apt to do things without a consideration,
especially when tourists are concerned.</p>

<p>By the time George and Josh had finished
their morning meal everything was in order
for making a start.</p>

<p>“It’s pretty tough to be running away like
this without having a chance to see what sort
of movies they have over here in Budapest,”
complained George, who was known to be a
steady attendant at the little theatre in his
home town, where all manner of dramas,
as well as world-wide views, were nightly
screened.</p>

<p>“So far as that goes,” Josh told him,
“they’re pretty much all alike here and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
home. Chances are you’d see some cowboy
pictures of the wild and woolly West; for they
do say those are the ones they like best abroad.
They know all about Buffalo Bill over here.
You know we saw an Austrian edition of some
highly colored story about his imaginary exploits
hanging up when we passed that book
stall.”</p>

<p>Working the boat free from all entanglements,
they were soon afloat once more on the
river. The motor had started working as
though it meant to do good service. Jack himself
as a rule took charge of the machinery, not
but that George knew all about such things,
but he had a decided failing, which was to
“monkey” with things even when they were
running satisfactorily, and thus bring about
sudden stoppages through his experiments.</p>

<p>“Look at the beautiful bridge we’re going
to pass under,” sang out Buster presently.
“It makes me think of one we saw in London.”</p>

<p>“There’s a bunch of Austrian officers walking
across,” said Josh, “and see how one of
them is pointing to us now.”</p>

<p>“Bet you they’re suspicious of us right
away, and mean to order us to go back,” said
George disconsolately.</p>

<p>“Rats!” scoffed Buster. “Don’t you see
they’re only admiring our little flag?&mdash;that’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
all. I’ve got the same fastened in the stern,
where it can show well. I only wish it was five
times as big, that’s all. But it stands for what
we are&mdash;true-blooded Americans, every one
of us.”</p>

<p>The officers even leaned over the parapet of
the bridge to stare at the boat as it passed
under. When the boys looked back a minute
or so later they saw that the uniformed Hungarians
had hurriedly crossed over and were
now gazing after them.</p>

<p>“Shows how seldom Old Glory is ever seen
in these parts,” said Josh, “for they hardly
know what to make of it. If I had my way,
can you guess what I’d do? Make the flag of
the free so well known and respected that
everywhere people’d kowtow to the same and
take off their hats.”</p>

<p>“Now they’re hurrying off the bridge,
seems like, as if they’d just remembered an
engagement somewhere,” reported Buster.</p>

<p>“I only hope they don’t start any sort of
trouble for us, that’s all,” George went on to
say, but, finding that no one seemed to be paying
any sort of attention to his grumbling, he
stopped short, as his kind always do.</p>

<p>Jack held the wheel and guided the boat
along through the numerous mazes of moving
river craft. He was a skillful pilot and could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
be depended on to mind his business every
time. Unlike George, Jack was plain and practical,
whereas the other never seemed satisfied
with what he had, but was always trying to
better conditions, often to his own and others’
discomfort, as well as possible delay.</p>

<p>By degrees they were now leaving the twin
cities behind them, and the river began to appear
more open and free to travel. The boys,
as usual, were calling each other’s attention to
such features of the landscape that attracted
their admiration, or it might be some of the
buildings they passed.</p>

<p>All of them were on the watch for special
sights, and in this way the time passed rapidly.
The little motor was a very good one, and
chugged away faithfully as it had continued to
do hour after hour ever since the start, which
was made far down the river below Vienna.</p>

<p>They overtook other vessels frequently,
since the Danube is navigable for the greater
part of its long course. Rising away over in
Germany near the border of Luxemburg, it
winds its sinuous way through the greater part
of Germany and Austria-Hungary, strikes the
Serbian border, turns sharply to the east, and
then touches Bulgarian territory, forms the
dividing line between Rumania and Bulgaria,
then crosses the former monarchy, and serves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
as a border between Rumania and Russia, to
finally empty into the Black Sea.</p>

<p>It is by long odds the greatest river in Europe,
and in all the world there can be found
no stream upon whose borders live so many
different nationalities. That was one reason
Jack Stormways had yearned to cruise down
the Danube; and he was even now trying to get
all the pleasure possible out of the trip, though
the clouds had arisen so early in the venture.</p>

<p>Budapest was now far in the rear, though
they could see the smoke that arose in a few
localities, coming from certain factories producing
articles for which the Hungarian capital
is famous.</p>

<p>Josh happened to notice about this time that
George seemed to be amusing himself by shading
his eyes with one hand and looking backward.</p>

<p>“What now, old croaker?” he ventured to
say. “Do you imagine you see a patrol boat
chasing after us hotfooted, with orders to
bring us back and throw us in a black dungeon,
charged with being desperate spies?”</p>

<p>“Laugh as much as you want to,” retorted
George stubbornly, “but all the same there <em>is</em>
a boat hustling along after us.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say!” gibed Josh, without bothering
to turn his head to look. “Well, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
when have we taken out a mortgage on the
Danube, please tell me? I guess it’s free cruising
ground for anybody who can afford to own
a steam yacht, or even a common little dinky
motorboat.”</p>

<p>“She certainly is coming hand over fist after
us,” asserted Buster.</p>

<p>“Well, the river is sure wide enough for two,
and when she comes up we’ll give her a chance
to pass us by. Whew! but I’m sleepy, if you
want to know it,” and Josh yawned and
stretched, but still declined to bother turning
his head.</p>

<p>A little while later George again made a remark.</p>

<p>“Now that they’re coming closer, I believe
I can see several people in uniforms aboard
that swift little boat.”</p>

<p>Jack took a look on hearing this.</p>

<p>“You’re right there, George,” he assented;
“but then there’s nothing to hinder Magyar
officers going on the river when they choose.
In fact, I imagine they pass plenty of their
time that way when off duty.”</p>

<p>Josh could not hold out after that any
longer, but condescended to lazily turn and indifferently
survey the approaching craft.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s a dandy for speed, all right,” he
frankly admitted, “and could make circles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
around our old tub if the skipper wanted. Yes,
those are soldiers on board, I’ll admit, but how
can you decide that they want to overhaul us,
I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“I’m only guessing when I say that,” acknowledged
George; “but now that I look
sharper it strikes me one of those officers is the
tall chap wearing the feather in his hat that we
noticed on the bridge. How about it, Jack?”</p>

<p>“He looks like that man, but then there are
probably scores in Budapest who wear that
same kind of hat, Alpine style. He’s probably
an officer of the mountaineer corps, those fellows
from the Carnic Alps who can do such
wonderful stunts in scaling dizzy heights.”</p>

<p>“Well, we must soon know if there’s going
to be any sort of a row,” said George, “because
in ten minutes or less they’ll overtake us.”</p>

<p>“There must be no row, remember, boys,”
advised Jack. “If we attempted to resist arrest
we’d soon be trapped, for they would send
word down-river way about us by telegraph or
telephone, and officers would be on the watch
for us all along the route. Don’t forget that.”</p>

<p>“Paste it in your hat, George,” advised
Josh, “for I reckon you’re the only one in the
bunch liable to make trouble. If they want to
take me back and give me free lodging, I’ll go
as meek as Mary’s little lamb. But whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
you do, George, <em>please</em> be careful how you fling
that German of yours around loose. If you
called one of those fiery Hungarian officers a
<em>donkey</em> by mistake I think he’d want to run
you through the ribs with his sword.”</p>

<p>“Huh! wait and see. That German you pretend
to make so much fun about may some day
keep you from being hung or stood up against
a blank wall. Stranger things than that have
happened, let me tell you, Josh Purdue.”</p>

<p>“They keep pushing us right along,” announced
Buster, beginning to feel quite an interest
in the affair by this time.</p>

<p>“Get ready to give them the right of way,
Jack,” jeered Josh. “We wouldn’t want to
act greedy, you know, and claim the whole
river. And when they whiz past look out you
don’t get splashed, Buster.”</p>

<p>“Goodness! I hope you don’t mean to say
they might swamp us away out here in the
middle of the river. But there, I know you’re
only being true to your name, Josh. Who’s
afraid? You don’t get me to worrying any if
I know it.”</p>

<p>“Look again and see what’s happening!”
suddenly snapped George, with a ring of triumph
in his voice.</p>

<p>“They’re waving to us, for a fact!” admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Buster. “Now what d’ye suppose that can
be for, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Just saluting our little flag, mebbe,” suggested
the unconverted Josh.</p>

<p>“They are demanding that we pull up and
wait for them, that’s what!” asserted George,
with a superior air that he liked to assume on
occasions like this.</p>

<p>“Is he right there, Jack?” asked Buster
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I think that’s what is meant,” assented the
pilot and engineer of the powerboat the boys
had chartered. “They are suspicious of us,
and mean to have a look in before allowing us
to proceed.”</p>

<p>“But why should anybody be suspicious of
four honest-looking boys out for a little fun?”
demanded Josh. “We’ve met heaps of other
people before now, and they acted just as nice
as you please. I don’t understand it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you must remember,” admonished
Jack, “that something <em>terrible</em> has happened
since yesterday morning. Every military man
in Germany and Austria has been on needles
and pins about this war business ever since
Serbia defied Francis Joseph and some of her
adventurers murdered the heir apparent to the
Austrian throne. And now that war has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
broken out, they are all eager to show their
fidelity to their country.”</p>

<p>“But will you stop for them, Jack?” asked
Josh.</p>

<p>“It would be foolish not to,” he was told,
“because you can see it’s only a matter of ten
minutes at most when they will have overhauled
us. It pays to be courteous, especially,
I’m told, when dealing with the military authorities
over here. Besides, in war times they
rule the roost.”</p>

<p>“I guess they do all the time,” muttered
Josh; “but then you’re right about it, Jack.
We must get ready to show them just who and
what we are. If they’re sensible men they’ll
let us go on down the river as we’ve planned.”</p>

<p>“And supposing they happen to be unreasonable
men?” queried Buster.</p>

<p>“Oh, some of the dungeons may be large
enough to hold you, perhaps,” laughed
George; “but I can see your finish on a diet of
bread and water, mostly water. You will
waste away to a shadow before you get out,
Buster.”</p>

<p>The other only gave him a scornful look, as
much as to say he was not worrying any about
that part of the game, for he knew he could
rely on Jack to pull them all through safely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>So Jack shut off the power, and the clumsy
but comfortable boat lay wallowing on the surface
of the river, awaiting the coming of the
speedy craft containing the Hungarian army
officers.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>UNDER SUSPICION</small></h2>


<p>Although every one tried to put the best face
on the matter, afterwards more than one of
the boys frankly confessed that his heart was
beating furiously during that time when waiting
for the speed boat to come up.</p>

<p>They were in a strange land, it must be remembered,
and the habits of the Magyars were
unfamiliar to them. More than this, war had
just been declared, which was sure to mean
that Austria-Hungary would be at handgrips
with not only Serbia on the south, but great
Russia as well.</p>

<p>They gathered at the stern of the boat and
awaited whatever fate had in store for them.
Josh was so much afraid even then that George
might be tempted to try his American German
on the Hungarian officers that he immediately
made a suggestion.</p>

<p>“Remember, now, everybody keep still but
Jack. That’s meant for you, Buster, as well
as George here. The rest of us are apt to get
excited and do our case more harm than good
if we butt in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m as mum as an oyster, Josh,” said Buster
readily.</p>

<p>“How about you, George?” demanded the
other sternly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll promise all right,” mumbled
George, shaking his head; “but all the same, I
do it under protest. You don’t know what you
may be missing when you put the muzzle on a
fellow that way. But I’m used to being sat on,
and I guess I can stand for it again.”</p>

<p>Jack himself was pleased to hear Josh settle
this. He had feared that George, who could
make himself more or less of a busybody when
he chose, might break in when the negotiations
were well under way and possibly spoil the
whole business.</p>

<p>But they would at least soon know the worst,
for the other boat was coming on at great
speed and about to draw alongside.</p>

<p>The man at the wheel knew his part of the
business perfectly, for when the craft came together
the bump was hardly noticeable.</p>

<p>There were just three of the Hungarian officers,
all of them dressed in their attractive
uniforms, with little capes hanging from their
shoulders and their lower limbs encased in
shiny boots with tassels. Indeed, Buster just
stared at them in sheer admiration, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
thought he had never in all his life looked upon
such handsome soldiers.</p>

<p>Apparently the tall one must have been the
superior of the trio, for he took it upon himself
to do the talking.</p>

<p>All of them were looking curiously at the
four lads. They evidently hardly knew what
to make of them, for, while outwardly Jack
and his chums had the appearance of harmless
young chaps off for a holiday, nevertheless in
such dark times as now hung over the Fatherland
it was not well to be too easily deceived.
Spies must be abroad, under many disguises;
and if so, why not playing the part of innocent
tourists, was no doubt the question uppermost
in each of their minds.</p>

<p>Then the tall officer said something. His
voice was filled with authority and his face
frowning, but of course none of the boys could
understand a word he uttered, for the Magyar
tongue was a sealed book to them.</p>

<p>They could, of course, give a pretty good
guess that he was asking who they were and
what they might be doing there. George
sighed as though it nearly broke his ardent
heart to be deprived of this golden opportunity
to air some of his German. He had perhaps
managed to remember certain words that
would serve to partly explain the situation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
but a savage nudge from Josh caused him to
shut his teeth fiercely together and get a fresh
grip on himself.</p>

<p>Then Jack tried an experiment.</p>

<p>“We do not understand what you say, because
none of us can speak the language. We
only know English. We would be glad to explain
everything if you could understand what
we tell you.”</p>

<p>The tall man listened attentively and then
immediately turned to his comrades to say
something to them. It was just as if he remarked,
“Didn’t I tell you they must be English?”
for Jack caught the concluding word.</p>

<p>Then, turning again to them, the officer
went on:</p>

<p>“Certainly we can speak English as well as
is necessary. We have many tourists in our
country each summer. I myself have a number
of very good friends among the English,
though when we meet again it may be as bitter
enemies.”</p>

<p>Jack saw that there need be no further
trouble in explaining matters. He felt decidedly
relieved over the sudden change in the
situation. Only George frowned, for possibly
he had been entertaining a forlorn hope that in
the end Jack might have to call on him to save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the day, and now he knew that chance was
doomed.</p>

<p>“I am glad you can understand what I want
to tell you,” Jack proceeded. “In the first
place, we are not English at all, but from
America.”</p>

<p>Again the three Hungarians exchanged significant
looks. Evidently they did not know
whether to believe the assertion or not.</p>

<p>“We have great regard for America,” the
tall man went on to say, “for many of our
countrymen are there, making an honest living
and helping to support their kin on this side of
the water. Of course, then, you can show us
your passports?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir, and with pleasure,” responded
Jack.</p>

<p>His words served as the signal to the others.
Every fellow immediately hastened to dive
into his breast pocket and produce the necessary
paper, which was always kept in an especially
safe place for fear of trouble in case of
its being lost.</p>

<p>The officer took the sheaf of papers and proceeded
to critically examine the passports, as
though looking for signs of fraud. Buster
watched him anxiously. He had heard that
when war came upon a country all ordinary
protection for tourists is annulled, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
passports may not be worth the paper they are
written on.</p>

<p>Greatly to Buster’s relief he saw that the
tall officer did not look at them so ferociously
after he had scanned the papers, which he now
handed back to Jack in a bunch.</p>

<p>“They seem to be perfectly correct, so far
as I can see,” he proceeded to say; “but perhaps
you would not mind explaining what
your object is in coming down the Danube in
this powerboat?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be only too glad to do that, sir,” Jack
announced, with one of his winning smiles that
always caused people to feel kindly toward
him. “Over in our own country we have three
motorboats, with which six of us in times past
have made many exciting cruises along the
great rivers, and the coast as well.”</p>

<p>The officer nodded his head, while his face
lighted up. Evidently he could appreciate the
love for adventure that induced these healthy
specimens of boyhood to want to be in the open
air all they could. Perhaps whenever he had
the chance for an outing he might have been
found off in the mountains, hunting the wild
boar, or it might be in pursuit of the nimble
chamois.</p>

<p>“When we had a chance to come to Europe
this summer,” continued Jack, “we decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
that the thing we would like best of all would
be a long trip down the beautiful blue Danube.
I had just been reading an account of a cruise
taken by an Englishman from near the source
down to the Black Sea. While we couldn’t
spare the time for all that, we could come to
Vienna, find where a suitable boat could be
chartered half-way to Budapest, and make our
start there. And, sir, that is what we have
done. We are now just two days on the way.”</p>

<p>“I admire your courage, as well as your
choice of the Danube for your trip. Many a
voyage have I taken on its waters when I was
younger. But how long have you been at
Budapest, may I ask?”</p>

<p>Jack knew that there was only one way to
treat such a questioner, and that was by being
perfectly frank with him.</p>

<p>“We only arrived late yesterday afternoon,
to tell the truth, sir,” he admitted.</p>

<p>“But how comes it you are leaving so early
the next morning?” asked the officer, with a
little fresh suspicion in his manner. “We
have a most beautiful and renowned city here,
and travelers usually find it difficult to tear
themselves away from it, even after a stay of
days. You seem to have been in a great
hurry.”</p>

<p>“We own up that we are, sir,” continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Jack. “You see, the first thing I did on arriving
was to hasten to the postoffice for our letters
from home. It was then that I realized
the city was in a feverish state of excitement.
I suspected what must have happened, for we
heard rumors when above. I managed to learn
that war had been declared by Germany on
Russia, which would mean for Austria-Hungary,
too. And after we had talked it all over
we decided that it would be best for us not to
waste any time here, but hurry along our
way.”</p>

<p>“Would you mind showing me those letters?”
asked the officer.</p>

<p>“With the greatest of pleasure, sir,” Jack
told him. “Boys, hand him the last ones you
received, please.”</p>

<p>The other took them as they were thrust out.
He examined the postmarks as if making sure
of the dates, and also read each name in turn.
Then he deliberately opened that belonging to
Jack and seemed to be glancing over it, though
the boy felt rather surprised to see him do this.</p>

<p>Still, it was good to find the officer nodding
his head as he gleaned something of the contents.
At least he could see it was genuine,
and that counted for a good deal.</p>

<p>“I am quite satisfied now that you are just
what you claim to be&mdash;tourists, who have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
connection with our enemies, or those who in
a short time we must look on as such. You are
wondering, no doubt, why I went so far as to
pry into the contents of your letter from home,
and I believe an explanation is due. To tell
the truth, we rested under the belief that you
were four desperate young Serbian youths,
who were said to be on their way up the Danube
bound for Vienna, with the mad intention
of trying to assassinate our good kaiser, Francis
Joseph, just as the Austrian heir apparent
to the throne was killed not long ago.”</p>

<p>Buster could not keep from giving a little
gasp at hearing this. Really never before, so
far as he knew, had he been taken for a desperado.
He did not know whether to be
ashamed or flattered. It would be something
with which to thrill those boy comrades at
home, if ever they were lucky enough to get
safely back again.</p>

<p>“That would be a serious charge against us,
I am sure,” said Jack; “but it pleases us to
know that you are now convinced we are not
what you thought. Seeing four strangers in a
boat, and all young at that, of course made you
suspicious.”</p>

<p>“The fact that you were headed down-stream
puzzled us considerably,” continued
the officer, apparently willing to explain things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
in order to prove that he and his comrades
were only doing their duty; “but we figured
that something may have caused a change in
plans, perhaps the breaking out of war, and
that the four desperate Serbians were on the
way back to their native land.”</p>

<p>“After all, we should not be sorry for what
has happened,” diplomatic Jack went on to
say, “since it has given us the pleasure of
meeting three such excellent gentlemen. I
hope, though, there need be no necessity for
causing us to alter our plans, since our hearts
are set on finishing the voyage, and we will
never have the opportunity for visiting your
great country again.”</p>

<p>Every one of them held his breath while
waiting for the officer to make a reply to this
question. He looked around at the half circle
of anxious faces and smiled indulgently. No
doubt just then he put himself in their place
and tried to realize how much it might mean
to be simply let alone.</p>

<p>“I do not mean to demand that you turn
back,” he finally told Jack, “for that would
really be exceeding my authority; but I would
feel that I had not done my full duty if I did
not warn you of the perils you will likely encounter
below here. By the time you reach the
Serbian border it is more than likely there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
will be desperate fighting going on between
Hungarians and Serbians, for they are ready
to-day to fly at one another’s throat. You
will find yourselves in great danger before you
can pass the Iron Gate and enter Rumania.”</p>

<p>Jack only smiled reassuringly at him.</p>

<p>“Thank you many times, sir, for taking
enough interest in us to give that kind warning,”
he remarked warmly; “but we have
passed through some pretty lively adventures
in the past and always managed to come out
safely. We will try and be careful how we act
when the time comes; and once past the Serbian
border along the Danube we need fear little
else.”</p>

<p>“Well, I admire your boldness, while at the
same time I fear you may be making a mistake.
We will wish you a pleasant trip, and that you
reach your goal in safety. What are your
plans after arriving at the sea, may I ask?”</p>

<p>“We have arranged to send the boat back to
the owner at our expense,” explained Jack.
“Then we will find some way of getting to
Constantinople, where we hope to remain a
short time, looking around. From there we go
to Italy, and then back to London to sail for
home about October fifteenth.”</p>

<p>“Ah! what wonderful things may happen in
those ten weeks!” remarked the officer, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
though he might be trying to lift the veil that
hid the future. “History will be in the making,
I fear, and all Europe be torn up with the
war clouds. But better so than the armed
peace that has existed so long. A storm is
necessary once in so often to clear the atmosphere
which has become murky.”</p>

<p>He thrust out his hand to Jack, who gladly
seized it.</p>

<p>“May the best of luck follow you all the
way, is the wish of myself and my comrades
here,” the tall officer told them as in turn he
pressed each boy’s hand, in which genial undertaking
he was followed by the other pair,
who, although taking no part in all the talking,
had been earnest listeners.</p>

<p>Then the speed boat backed away, made a
sweeping turn, and was soon heading up the
Danube again. The boys waved their hats to
the three gaily dressed Hungarian soldiers
seated in the other craft, and were in turn saluted
by the trio.</p>

<p>After that Jack again started the engine,
and they began moving with the current at a
lively rate.</p>

<p>“Well, that was a new experience, now!”
exclaimed Josh; “and we are mighty lucky to
have escaped being taken back to Budapest
and shut up in a dungeon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, it was easy, after all,” grumbled
George; “but who’d think Hungarian officers
would know English so well?”</p>

<p>“And just to think of our being taken for a
lot of desperate Serbian youths sworn to get
the aged and benevolent Emperor Francis
Joseph! Ugh! it’ll give me a shiver every time
I think of it. I never dreamed before that I
looked like a fellow who would take his life in
his hand to do such a terrible thing.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>SIGNS OF COMING TROUBLE</small></h2>


<p>All day long the powerboat kept constantly
moving down the reaches of the Danube River.
Many were the interesting sights the boys
looked upon from time to time. Nor did they
see any particular signs of overhanging
trouble. War may have been declared by Austria-Hungary
upon Serbia and Russia, backing
up the action of her ally, Germany, but the
indications of it were not immediately apparent.</p>

<p>It was true that in several towns which they
passed on that morning’s run they could see
that groups were in the streets, and there
seemed to be many men in uniform hurrying
this way or that. Once they also saw a field
battery of glistening guns disappearing up a
steep road that led to the south.</p>

<p>“You can see what’s in the wind, all right,”
Josh remarked, as they watched a group of
uniformed horsemen galloping along the river
road as though bound for some distant point
of mobilization. “In a few days after the call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to the colors, as they say, has gone out for
many classes of reserves, the whole country
will be swarming with men in uniform.”</p>

<p>“I only wish we could hold over and see
what goes on,” grumbled George. “It’s a
chance in a lifetime to be a looker-on in a foreign
country, with war breaking out; and I
think it’s a shame that we are going to miss it.”</p>

<p>Jack took him to task for saying that.</p>

<p>“We ought to thank our lucky stars, on the
other hand, George,” was the way he put it,
“that we have a chance to get out of Austria
before every exit is closed. I wouldn’t be surprised
if a lot of tourists have the time of their
lives escaping, because, you see, every train
will be taken over by the Government for carrying
soldiers, guns, ammunition, horses,
stores and such army necessities.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Buster, “that’s what I say,
Jack. For one I want to tell you I’m mighty
thankful to be on board this old boat right now.
I only hope they won’t want to commandeer it
for carrying soldiers down to the Serbian border.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they wouldn’t want to bother with such
a mosquito craft as this, I should think,” remarked
Josh uneasily.</p>

<p>“Our little flag seems to attract a heap of
attention,” Buster continued, with a vein of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
pride in his voice, for that small edition of Old
Glory was his private possession, it may be
remembered.</p>

<p>“Where we landed at noon to see if we could
buy some eggs and milk at that farm house,”
Josh observed, “those peasant girls were examining
it. I rather think they must have
somebody over in our country, for when I said
the word ‘America’ and pointed to the flag and
then myself they laughed and nodded their
heads.”</p>

<p>“And don’t forget to mention, please,
George, that we got the eggs all right,” suggested
Buster; “likewise a bumper mug of
fresh milk apiece, and some butter that didn’t
have a bit of salt in it, which I think queer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so far as that goes,” explained Jack,
“there’s lots of that made and sold over here.
They call it sweet butter, and most people like
it. You’d get used to it in time.”</p>

<p>“Four dozen eggs, and whoppers at that,”
Buster went on to say, gloatingly; “which I
consider a splendid investment; and we didn’t
have to pay half what they’d cost us in the
States either. I’m going to have a couple fried
for my supper, and anybody else that likes
them that way can get what they want by giving
the tip now.”</p>

<p>They continued to chatter in this manner as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the afternoon wore away. It had been decided
that while there was a full moon that night
they had better not attempt navigating the
river after the sun had set. None of them
knew what they might run up against; and besides,
since war had come, possibly there would
be strict rules enforced prohibiting such a
thing during the night. None of them felt like
taking chances.</p>

<p>Buster, it seems, must have been thinking of
some of his previous exploits in the times that
were gone, for later on he was seen to be looking
over some fishing tackle he produced from
his pack.</p>

<p>“Hey! what’s in the wind now, Buster?”
sang out Josh upon discovering what the fat
chum was doing.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much,” replied the other easily,
“only it struck me that there might be
some kind of eatable fish in this same blue
Danube, and I’m looking over my lines. To-night,
if I can find any fat grubs or worms, I
might set a line and see what happens. You
know I’ve had more or less success about grabbing
big fish out of fresh and salt water.”</p>

<p>That seemed to make the others laugh, as
though certain humorous memories were refreshed.
Buster joined them, for he was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
jolly fellow and could even enjoy a joke when
it was on himself.</p>

<p>“I mean to drop one of these lines over as
we go along, so as to soak the snell of the hook,
for if it’s too dry it might break,” Buster explained.</p>

<p>“Well, here’s wishing that you meet with
good luck,” said Josh, “because I’d enjoy a
supper of fresh fish pretty good.”</p>

<p>“Don’t make up your mouth for it, then,”
warned George, “because you never can tell
about such things. Fish are what some people
would call notionate; they bite well one day
and then given you the grand laugh the next
one.”</p>

<p>“About how far do you think we’ve come
since leaving Budapest, Jack?” Buster asked,
not deigning to continue the discussion with
George.</p>

<p>“I should think something like fifty to sixty
miles,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Whew! as much as that?” whiffed George.</p>

<p>“Well, this current must be all of four miles
an hour, and the old boat when going with it
ought to average ten. Counting for our stops
and all that, we’ve certainly covered sixty
miles if we have one.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you, Jack,” said Josh;
“George is only saying that to be contrary.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I am, eh?” grinned George, who
seemed to take especial delight in stirring
Josh up.</p>

<p>“It’s been a pretty good day for August,
with the sun shining overhead most of the
time, and not so very hot at that,” Buster continued.
“There’s no sign of such a thing as a
storm that I can see&mdash;great guns! what in the
mischief can that queer-looking thing be over
yonder? Do they have birds shaped like a fat
cigar in the Danube country?”</p>

<p>Of course, every one immediately twisted
his head around to take a look, and all sorts of
exclamations announced that they were about
as much astonished as Buster.</p>

<p>Low down toward the horizon they saw an
object outlined against the sky that was undoubtedly
moving, for they could notice that
it passed a small cloud with considerable
speed. Just as Buster had said, it looked very
much in the distance like a fat cigar, and was
of a neutral tint, not very easily distinguished
against the heavens.</p>

<p>“Why, that must be one of those German
Zeppelins we’ve read so much about!” exclaimed
Jack, after taking a second look.</p>

<p>“A war dirigible, you mean, don’t you?” demanded
Josh.</p>

<p>“Nothing else,” he was told. “I’ve seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
pictures of them often, but never thought I’d
set eyes on one. Yes, it’s a Zeppelin, all right,
and heading due south, too.”</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean by saying that last?”
asked Josh.</p>

<p>“Well, you remember what that officer said
about the Serbians and Austrians on the
Danube down below, where it acts as a boundary
line, being ready to fight at the drop of
the hat? Perhaps they’re already having it
hot and heavy. Perhaps the word has been
flashed over the wires for one of the Zeppelins
to come down and get busy there.”</p>

<p>“What would they use it for, Jack?” questioned
Buster, as all of them continued to
watch the steady movement of the fast dirigible
in the west.</p>

<p>“I believe the main thing for Zeppelins to
do is to carry explosives and drop bombs from
a great height on forts and barracks occupied
by the enemy forces. But they can be also
used for scouting and bringing back information
of value. That may be what they want
this one down along the Danube for.”</p>

<p>So fast was the dirigible going that in a
quarter of an hour more it had passed beyond
the range of their vision.</p>

<p>“Looks like things are going to happen right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
along over in old Europe these days,” remarked
Josh.</p>

<p>“Yes, but we’ll know next to nothing about
it all,” George went on to say; “for we can’t
buy a paper, and even if we did none of us
could read Magyar. This thing of knocking
around in a foreign country may be all very
good when there’s no war on, but there are
times when you’d like to be able to buy an
extra and learn all that’s happening.”</p>

<p>“There’s a good landing by that tree yonder,
Jack,” remarked Josh.</p>

<p>“But we’re not quite ready to pull in yet a
while,” the commodore announced.</p>

<p>“What’s the hurry, Josh?” asked Buster,
again working at his long and strong fish line.</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought George wanted to get out
and start right away back,” answered the
other with a dry chuckle. “He’ll never be
happy until he can have all the comforts of
home, including the afternoon extra to read.”</p>

<p>“Forget it!” snapped George. “I’ve always
been able to take things as they came as
well as the next one, and I reckon I can stand
what you fellows do. Because I grumble a
little once in a great while, that’s no sign I’m
not having a good time. Some of my folks
must have been sailors, I guess, and it runs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the blood. Don’t pay any attention when you
hear me complain.”</p>

<p>“We’ll try not to, George,” promised Josh
blithely; “we’ll have to remember the source,
and then forget it.”</p>

<p>“There, now, I’ve got the silly old line untangled,”
announced Buster; “and I’ll let the
hook and sinker trail after us, just to make believe
I’m fishing. It’ll do me a heap of good
to feel the twirl as the hook goes around with
the swivel&mdash;sort of revive old memories like.”</p>

<p>He lay there by the broad stern of the boat
amusing himself after his fashion. Josh could
not resist the temptation to warn him.</p>

<p>“Better look out for yourself, Buster,” he
remarked seriously. “Some hungry fish
might snap at your bare hook and get caught.
If you were taken off your guard the next
thing you knew you’d be overboard.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be the first time, either,” mentioned
George.</p>

<p>“Aw, no danger of that happening,” retorted
Buster good-naturedly. “Even over
here in Austria-Hungary the fish have their
eye-teeth cut, and wouldn’t be so green as to
bite at a bare hook. If I had anything to bait
it with I’d watch my steps, you may be sure.
But don’t worry yourself about me, either of
you. I can take care of myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>No more was said just then with reference
to the subject, something else coming up to
catch their attention.</p>

<p>The afternoon was nearing its close, and
Jack knew that before a great while they must
be on the lookout for a place to haul up for the
night. Whether they had better select a retired
nook for their camp, as had been their
habit when cruising down home rivers, or land
near some farm, he had not yet decided. Of
course, it would be unwise to stop over at any
town, since they might have more or less
trouble getting away again if the authorities
chose to be exacting.</p>

<p>“There goes a long train over there, heading
south, too,” remarked Josh, pointing as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“Seems like nearly everything is going the
same way we are, for a fact,” added George.</p>

<p>“It strikes me it must be a troop train,”
Jack was saying, “for, while I’m not dead
sure, I think I can see men in uniform leaning
from the windows of the carriages, as they
call the cars over here.”</p>

<p>“Well, what else could we expect?” Buster
wanted to know. “If Austria means to give
little Serbia a licking she’ll need a lot of her
soldiers down there, many more than she’s got
along the lower Danube now. Yes, they’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
soldiers, all right, Jack. I can see them
plainly in the sunlight.”</p>

<p>“The plot is thickening,” remarked George
solemnly; “and right now I wouldn’t be surprised
if the Germans were having a hot time
over in Belgium, if they’ve really started to
cross the little kingdom. They say those Belgians
are fighters to the backbone, and will
never stand by to let the Kaiser cross their
neutral country to strike at France.”</p>

<p>George was deeply interested in all that was
going on. He took pride in his knowledge of
things connected with the aspirations of these
countries, big and little, of Europe, and especially
of the turbulent Balkan States. While
George undoubtedly has his failings, as what
boy has not, as a rule he seemed well informed,
and could argue on almost any point.</p>

<p>“A lot of those fine chaps will like as not
never come back,” said Buster, as he gave the
fish line another idle hitch around his wrist,
preparatory to winding it in; “they start out
full of enthusiasm and life, and are brought
home again wrecks, fit for only the scrap
heap.”</p>

<p>“Listen to Buster, will you?” chuckled
Josh; “he’s getting to be a regular old philosopher
these days.”</p>

<p>“Well, it always did hurt me more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
when it came to parting with any one I cared
for a heap,” admitted the fat chum, trying to
look serious, though that was always a difficult
task with him, because nature had made his
round features to bear the stamp of a jovial
disposition; “you may remember that it took
me two whole days to recover when we left
home. I’m of a clinging nature, you see, and
this thing of severing the bonds goes against
my grain.”</p>

<p>He had just said this when something happened
that astounded the others. Buster
seemed to be dragged from the end of the moving
powerboat as though an octopus had suddenly
flung one of its long tendrils up and
clasped him.</p>

<p>The others heard Buster give one loud howl
of fright, and then the sound was swallowed
up in a splash as he disappeared in the river.</p>

<p>As Jack hastily stopped the engine and prepared
to back up, he had a glimpse of the stout
chum struggling desperately in the water. If
his frantic actions counted for anything, it
would seem as though Buster must be engaged
in a life-and-death struggle with some marine
monster that had pulled him from the after
deck of the powerboat and into the river.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>THE CAMP ON THE RIVER BANK</small></h2>


<p>“Keep a-going, Buster; we’re coming back
for you!” shrilled Josh, not a little alarmed on
account of seeing such a tremendous splashing
back where the stout chum was struggling in
the river.</p>

<p>Being compelled to fight against the steady
current, the boat could not make such very
rapid progress, especially when backing up.
Still it seemed as though Buster might be
swimming toward them. He was using only
one hand, and churning the water like the
paddle-wheel of a Mississippi steamboat.</p>

<p>“Whew!” they heard him say, after ejecting
a stream of water from his mouth, which
he persisted in keeping open; “a sockdolager,
I tell you! Going to beat all the records this
time. It must be a river horse, or a boss sturgeon,
boys. I want to save him, you bet!”</p>

<p>Evidently, like a true fisherman, Buster’s
first, last and only thought concerned the successful
landing of the game he had struck.
And presently the boat had come so close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the submerged boy that Jack stopped the engine
lest the propeller do Buster some material
damage.</p>

<p>Two of them leaned over the stern and with
great difficulty managed to drag the water-soaked
chum aboard.</p>

<p>“Sit there in the stern until you drain, Buster,”
ordered Jack. “If we took all that water
aboard we’d be in danger of foundering.”</p>

<p>“What ails your left hand?” demanded
Josh.</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you see,” explained George,
“the silly went and wound the line about his
wrist. Then when the fish took hold it was a
case of Buster going overboard or having his
left arm pulled out of its socket. No wonder
he lets it hang down like that now. I bet you
it hurts like fun.”</p>

<p>“But say, the bally old fish has quit pulling
like mad!” exclaimed Buster, as though that
circumstance troubled him much more than
any bodily pain he might be enduring.</p>

<p>Josh leaned forward and took hold of the
line. He even started to pull it in after the
manner of a skillful fisherman, while Buster
eyed him eagerly.</p>

<p>“Tell me you feel him pulling yet, Josh,
can’t you?” he pleaded. “Don’t break my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
heart by saying he’s gone! After all my fight
I deserve to land that monster.”</p>

<p>Josh chuckled.</p>

<p>“I do feel something now, all right, Buster,”
he remarked. “Watch me yank him
alongside in a hurry. You never could handle
such a monster with one of your arms next to
useless.”</p>

<p>So Josh worked away, possibly putting on
more or less, as though he were having the
time of his life in trying to drag the captive
alongside. Every little while he pretended to
lose a foot or so of line, whereupon Buster
would call out anxiously and beg him to keep a
tight hold on the glorious prize.</p>

<p>“Talk to me about having fish for supper,”
the dripping sportsman cried as he watched
for the first glimpse of his catch; “why, we
could feed a whole village on such a dandy as
this. And caught on a bare hook, too! Ain’t
I the lucky one for keeps? What d’ye know
about that?”</p>

<p>“There he comes, Buster!” cried Josh, pantingly;
“get ready now to help me pull him up
over the stern, all of you. My stars! but how
he does fight.”</p>

<p>In another moment Josh drew alongside a
small but broad-nosed <em>log</em>, which in floating
with the current of the river had suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
been snagged by the bare hook. The impact,
with the boat running as it was, had been severe
enough to drag the fisherman into the
water, for the stout line held, and he had foolishly
wrapped one end of the same around his
left wrist.</p>

<p>Jack and George shouted with mirth, and
Josh excelled them both. Buster looked down
at the now tamed “fish,” felt ruefully of his
lame arm, and then grinned.</p>

<p>“You bit, all right, fellows!” he blandly told
them; nor would he offer any further explanation,
so that to the end of the chapter none of
them really knew whether Buster had been
playing a trick on them or not by pretending
to fight the object at the end of his line and
showing such tremendous solicitude while Josh
was pulling in the same.</p>

<p>“What am I going to do about drying off?”
asked Buster a little later, after he had succeeded
in reeling in all his line without getting
it very much tangled&mdash;the log he allowed to
float off on the current, having no use for it,
though Josh did ask him if he had never heard
of “planked fish.”</p>

<p>“You’re draining right along,” George told
him; “and as the weather is so nice and warm
there’s no danger of your taking cold, I
guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“When we get ashore,” Jack explained, “we
can start a fire, and that will give you a chance
to get dry. But I’m sorry about that arm, Buster.
It may give you some trouble, because the
jerk must have been fierce.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should say it was,” admitted the
other, with a sigh. “I thought my arm would
come off sure. But then the excitement kept
me up, you see. And I knew right well you’d
stop the boat and come back after me. But
Jack, later on I want you to rub my arm with
that liniment you carry with you. Chances are
it’ll be black and blue along the muscles. It
hurts like fun even now.”</p>

<p>Jack considered that the sooner this was
done the better, so he turned the wheel over to
George, and bidding Buster bare his arm, proceeded
to give it a good rubbing with the liniment
he knew to be fine for this purpose.</p>

<p>Buster was glad to find that as yet there
were no signs of discoloration, as he had
feared.</p>

<p>“It may last a few days,” he cheerfully declared,
“but that’s the extent of the damage. I
consider that I came off better than I deserved.
But then, who’d think a bare hook would catch
anything?”</p>

<p>“Well, Buster,” warned George, “be sure
you don’t fasten your fishline to your leg, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
around your neck. You never can tell what’s
going to happen; and after you’re drowned it’s
no time to be sorry.”</p>

<p>“I think we’d better go ashore below, where
the trees come down to the edge of the bank,”
suggested Jack just then, showing that all this
while he had been keeping a sharp lookout
ahead.</p>

<p>“It makes me think of places where we’ve
pulled up over along the old Mississippi,” said
Josh; “I wonder now do they have tramps over
here, who prowl around looking for a chance
to steal what they can lay hands on.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they do,” George told him;
“for they regulate such things a lot better than
we do over the big water. Tramps are a luxury
here, while with us they flourish like the green
bay tree; the woods are full of them.”</p>

<p>Jack took the boat in closer to the shore. On
seeing the proposed landing place at closer
quarters all of them seemed to be of the same
opinion. It looked like just the camping
ground they were looking for. A fire might be
built for cooking purposes, and the district
seemed lonely enough to make it appear that
they might not be disturbed during their short
stay of a single night.</p>

<p>On the following morning they expected to
be once more on the move down the long and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
sinuous stream that covered hundreds of miles
before emptying its clear water into the Black
Sea.</p>

<p>As soon as the landing was effected Buster
waddled clumsily ashore.</p>

<p>“I hope somebody will have the kindness
now to get that blaze started right away,” he
was saying; “I’d do it myself, but I’m afraid
all the matches I had in my pocket must have
been soaked, and they wouldn’t light easy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of the fire, and do the cooking
tonight in the bargain if you want me to, Buster,”
Josh told him.</p>

<p>“That’s kind of you, Josh, and I won’t forget
it in a hurry, either. Fact is this arm of
mine pains a little too much for me to sling the
pots and skillets around in my customary way.
But fry me two eggs, remember, Josh; I’d say
three if nobody kicked up any sort of a row.”</p>

<p>“You shall have them, Buster,” Josh told
him; “because the chances are we can pick up
as many as we want as we go along.”</p>

<p>“But no fish for supper tonight, how’s
that?” George demanded, trying to frown at
Buster.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, nobody really promised you any,”
the latter explained. “But if there are any fat
grubs in some of those rotten stumps around
here I’m meaning to have a line out with three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
hooks to-night, and mebbe, George, you can
indulge in fresh fish for breakfast. Will
that do?”</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll have to make it; besides, ham
and eggs suits my taste well enough this time.
I’ll forgive you, Buster, only be careful not to
get our mouths watering for fish again when
it’s only a floating log you’ve caught.”</p>

<p>Josh was already busy with the fire. He had
long since graduated in this department of
woodcraft, and knew about all there was going
in connection with fires of every description.</p>

<p>Then, too, he could cook in a way to make the
mouths of his chums fairly water. Josh had
a way of browning things so cleverly that they
were unusually attractive, where so many boys
more careless would frequently burn whatever
they had on the fire, and in a happy-go-lucky
fashion dub it “pot-luck.”</p>

<p>“One thing sure,” said Jack, as they sat
around waiting for the call to supper, “we’re
a lucky set to have two such willing workers
with the pots and pans as Buster and Josh
here.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” declared George, agreeable
for once; “it would be hard to find their match,
search where you will. What one lacks the
other makes up for, and the opposite way
around too. And we want them to know we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
appreciate their services, don’t we, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Come, now, no taffy, George,” said Josh,
though his eyes sparkled under praise from
such a source; “as they used to say in olden
days, beware the Greeks who come bearing
gifts. And when <em>you</em> get to praising anything
there must be a deep motive back of it.”</p>

<p>“There is,” assented George frankly, “a
very deep motive, for I’m hollow all the way
down to my heels, seems like. Sure the grub
must be done by now, Josh. That’s a good fellow,
ring the bell for us to gather round.”</p>

<p>Whenever these lads were sitting about the
camp fire they always had plenty of fun on tap.
If “jabs” were given at times it was done with
such good-natured chaff that no one could get
provoked.</p>

<p>So they started to discuss the supper Josh
had prepared. Meanwhile Buster had managed
to dry himself after a fashion by turning
around near the fire, presenting first one side
and then another to the heat. He likened himself
to a roast fowl on the spit, and jokingly
asked the others how they would have him
served.</p>

<p>“After I’m all through eating my share of
the excellent mess Josh here has provided for
us,” Buster remarked, when his mouth
chanced to be empty, which was not often, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the way, “I know what I mean to do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, anybody can guess that the first shot
out of the locker,” George asserted; “that is if
they know what a fellow you are for remembering
things. Of course you mean to smash
some of these rotten stumps, and find out if
they contain any grubs. Stumps are fine for
holding the same, I understand; at least over
where we live; and I guess grubs are grubs the
world over.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what I’m aiming to do,” Buster
admitted. “Just because I had the hard luck
to be dragged overboard by a measly old log,
don’t think I’m the one to be scared off. If
there are any fish in this Danube River, and
they like bait such as I can offer them, we’re
bound to have a mess for breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! That’s the ticket!” cried Josh;
“if at first you don’t succeed try, try again. I
plainly perceive that my honors as boss fisherman
are going to be put in peril if this thing
keeps on. I’ll sure have to get out a line myself,
and run you a race, Buster.”</p>

<p>“Wish you would,” snapped the other, as
though this just suited him.</p>

<p>“You remember,” continued Josh, “we had
some pretty tall rivalry in that line once or
twice before. Never mind who came out first
best; that’s ancient history, and pretty musty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
by now. You find enough worms and I’ll get a
rig ready, Buster.”</p>

<p>George rubbed his hands as though the prospect
looked pretty bright to him. With two ardent
anglers engaged in a warm contest to see
who could do the better in the way of making
captures, those who loved fresh fish might expect
to be well taken care of.</p>

<p>When the supper had been disposed of, and
every one declared he felt “full to the brim,”
Buster secured the little camp hatchet they had
been wise enough to fetch along with them, and
which had been a useful adjunct on many past
outings.</p>

<p>With this in hand he started to attack some
of the old stumps that could be seen scattered
around. Josh felt considerable interest in his
labors, as from time to time he could be heard
calling out, and asking what the score was.</p>

<p>“Got three dandies in that stump,” Buster
presently made answer, “and here’s a whole
nest of bigger ones than the others. Say, we’re
fixed all right, my friend, so far as plenty of
attractive bait goes. I can see a lovely time
among the finny tribes when some of these fat
boys get in the drink. They’ll actually fight
among themselves for a chance to bite; especially
if you spit on your hook after impaling
the grub.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>By the time he had placed a full dozen of the
victims of his hunt in the little can that had
contained sardines at one time, Buster pronounced
himself ready to begin serious operations.</p>

<p>Josh had in the meantime managed to get his
line ready just as Buster finished his work;
George told him it looked suspiciously as
though he had been “soldiering,” and meant
to let his rival do all the work; but gallant
Buster, hearing all this talk, immediately came
to the rescue.</p>

<p>“And why shouldn’t Josh take it easy, after
going to all the trouble to prepare that fine
supper?” he demanded. “You’ve got a bad
habit, George, of looking a gift horse in the
mouth, and the sooner you break yourself of it
the better. Now, come along Josh, and let’s
find a good place for throwing our lines out
into the river.”</p>

<p>“We’re not going to be partial or play favorites,”
warned Jack, laughingly; “may the
best man win; but please don’t try to give us
any more <em>planked shad</em>, Buster, you hear!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>WHEN THE STORM CAME</small></h2>


<p>As Buster had taken a survey of the situation
before darkness came along, he knew of a
promising point close at hand. Here they could
toss their lines out, and let the current drag
them partly down-stream.</p>

<p>It was not the kind of fishing that the boys
preferred, because they were accustomed to
using jointed rods, and even casting artificial
flies with which to lure the frisky trout or the
hard-pulling black bass to their destruction.
But as Buster wisely declared, “When you’re
fish hungry you’ve just got to shut your eyes
and get ’em any old way; results are what
count then, not methods.”</p>

<p>Presently Buster had a savage bite, and
drew in a squirming victim. He eyed this in
the light of the rising moon and then remarked:</p>

<p>“I don’t know the species that fellow belongs
to, but he looks good to me, and all I hope
is there are a lot of his uncles and his cousins
and his aunts hanging around, anxious for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
grub bait. Hello! Got one, have you, Josh?
Bully for you! Whew! He’s a scrapper in the
bargain, I tell you. I hope he doesn’t break
loose, and give us the grand laugh!”</p>

<p>Buster’s interest was so taken up with what
was going on near him that he forgot his own
line for the time being, until a quick summons
at the other end announced that one of the said
finny relations seemed anxious to follow the
first victim to the shore.</p>

<p>Then both boys were kept busy pulling in
hand over hand. They succeeded in landing
both prizes, which fact made them very joyful.</p>

<p>“Only needs one more to complete the first
circle, though I think I’d like two for my share,
Josh, and so might all the rest. You see there’s
a heap of waste when you come to take off the
head and tail. Let’s hurry up and get ’em
while the bitin’s good. You never can tell when
fish will quit takin’ hold.”</p>

<p>It was certainly less than half an hour after
they first started off when the two sportsmen
came strolling back to the bright camp fire dangling
a pretty string of still lively fish between
them on a little pole.</p>

<p>“Two apiece, and one left for luck!” announced
Buster, triumphantly, as the other fellows
jumped to their feet with expressions of
pleasure to look the catch over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“They ought to be cleaned right away, and a
little salt rubbed inside so they’ll keep nice and
fresh over night,” said Josh, “so let’s get busy,
Buster.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you think that ought to be our
part of the business?” asked George, although
there was not very much animation in his manner,
for George hated to handle the job of
cleaning fish, though when it came to eating
them no one ever knew him to make any objection.</p>

<p>“Now that’s kind of you, George, to offer to
do the thing for us,” observed Buster, sweetly;
“especially since we know how you detest the
job. Thank you, but as our hands are in, Josh
and me can attend to them all right.”</p>

<p>Josh, however, did not look overly well
pleased when he heard Buster say this. Truth
to tell, he had already arranged it in his wicked
heart that George should be trapped into “doing
something for his keep.”</p>

<p>“We’ll let you off this time, George,” he remarked,
pointedly, “but the very next batch of
fish we haul in you can tackle the job.”</p>

<p>George only chuckled, and drew a sigh of relief.
Perhaps he may have said to himself that
sometimes people count their chickens before
they are hatched, and that possibly there might
never be another “batch;” remembering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
story of the small boy who while eating an apple,
upon being appealed to by an envious comrade
to give him the core, told him “there ain’t
a-goin’ to be any core, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>In due time the fish were laid away in a safe
place where no roving animal was apt to discover
and appropriate them. Buster might in
his happy-go-lucky fashion have been careless
in this particular, but shrewd Josh was far too
smart to take unnecessary chances.</p>

<p>“We don’t know anything about the country
around here,” he told the others. “They may
have wild animals, and again p’raps there’s
nothing of the kind to be feared. But it’s best
to lock the stable <em>before</em> the horse is stolen.”</p>

<p>So the fish were kept aboard the boat, although
from time to time George might have
been observed to sniff the air suggestively as he
prepared to sleep, plainly indicating that he
disliked the fishy smell. But then George always
was what Josh called “finicky” in his
habits, and the rest seemed to pay little or no
attention to things that annoyed the particular
one.</p>

<p>When morning came, without any untoward
happening, Buster took particular pains to
cook that mess of fish to a beautiful brown
color. He followed the old and well known
camp method of first throwing several slices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of fat salt pork into the skillet and rendering it
down. Then when it was boiling hot he placed
as many of the fish as it would accommodate in
the pan, first rolling them in cracker dust.
Turning them back and forth as was necessary
he finally had them looking so appetizing that
the others refused to wait a minute longer, but
made a raid on the lot.</p>

<p>The breakfast was a pronounced success.
Even George was heard to say that he did not
care how soon it was repeated; which was quite
reckless on his part, since he had been given
due warning as to his duties next time.</p>

<p>The sun was well up and shining brightly
when they left the scene of their camp. It promised
to be a rather warm day, Josh predicted,
after taking a look around at the sky, and sizing
up the breeze. Josh pretended to be something
of a weather sharp, though hardly calling
himself a prophet along those lines.</p>

<p>“And,” said he, as they started down the
river again, “it wouldn’t surprise me a bit if
we ran into a squall before we see that old sun
go down tonight.”</p>

<p>“Do you really mean that, Josh?” asked
Buster.</p>

<p>“All humbug,” muttered George, disdainfully,
as though he never pinned any faith on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
“signs,” and considered all weather predictions
as founded on mere guess work.</p>

<p>Josh shrugged his shoulders as he went on to
say:</p>

<p>“Oh! very well, just wait and see if I know
beans or not, that’s all. They have some pretty
lively thunder storms along the Danube, I’m
told, and if that’s so what better time than in
August could you expect to run across one?
Course I may be mistaken, because I’m only a
tenderfoot of a weather sharp; but wait and
see.”</p>

<p>“Oh! we will, Josh, we will,” replied George,
in his tantalizing way.</p>

<p>The morning passed pleasantly enough,
though as noon came on it might be noticed that
everybody showed signs of being hot. The sun
certainly did blaze down upon them, and it was
even warmer inside the cabin of the powerboat
than outside, so it seemed useless trying to get
any relief by seeking the shade.</p>

<p>They drew in at a place where there were
trees, just to lie around for possibly an hour
under their shelter, while they ate a cold
“snack.” It was too furiously hot to dream of
building a fire and making a pot of coffee.</p>

<p>Then once again they embarked for another
run down-stream. Jack figured they had covered
more distance that morning by five miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
than on the other day. This fact cheered them
up immensely, and as they continued to go with
the current they took their customary interest
in what was to be seen along the eastern shore,
where they would not have the bright rays of
the declining sun in their eyes.</p>

<p>Many were the odd sights they beheld from
time to time. First it was this thing that attracted
them, and hardly had their exclamations
of delight ceased than something else
would be discovered further down that chained
their attention until they were close enough to
make out its character.</p>

<p>One thing Jack called their attention to, and
this was the fact that they were meeting with
more evidences of mobilization than ever, as
they proceeded further from the Hungarian
capital.</p>

<p>The news may have been belated in reaching
many of these interior hamlets and pretty little
towns along the Danube; but it must have arrived
at last, and no end of excitement had followed.</p>

<p>They saw scores and even hundreds of men
in uniform, some marching in squads as if
hurrying to join the colors; others guarding
bridges, or other vulnerable structures, the latter
doubtless being old men who could not go to
the front, though still possessing the military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
spirit, and desirous of doing something for the
country of his birth.</p>

<p>Jack was delighted with this chance to see
things he had often read about but never really
expected to set eyes on.</p>

<p>“I used to believe that it was a terrible crime
to have every young fellow serve a couple of
years in the army before he could go into business,
and then be reckoned as belonging to the
reserves, but I’m changing my mind some, let
me tell you,” was what he said later in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>“How’s that, Jack?” asked Buster.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued the other, obligingly, “in
the first place it makes for a love for their country
when they know they represent a unit in
her defense. Then again it goes to make the
young fellows amenable to discipline, something
millions of boys in our country are lacking
in. It teaches them to be frugal, and the
life outdoors makes them a lot more healthy.”</p>

<p>“Sounds good to me, Jack,” assented Josh.</p>

<p>“I know we’ve done a heap of talking over
in America about the mad folly of Germany in
making every young man serve a term in the
army, and boasted that our boys needn’t ever
fear of being forced to join the colors; but perhaps,
fellows, after this world war is over, we’ll
be doing the same thing. Preparedness is what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
is going to count for a whole lot, let me tell you;
and both Great Britain and the States will
learn a lesson before they’re through.”</p>

<p>At the time of course Jack was only taking a
vague peep into the future; but events that
have happened since then show he had a wise
head on his young shoulders. When these words
are being penned camps are springing up all
over the States where business men can have a
month’s training in military ways; and those
who come back home admit that they have
taken on a new lease of life, such are the great
benefits to be obtained in that fashion.</p>

<p>It must have been past the middle of the hot
afternoon, when the boys were lolling about,
almost panting for breath, and taking things as
easy as possible, that a sudden sound startled
them.</p>

<p>“Thunder!” ejaculated Buster, as he popped
up his head to look around.</p>

<p>Black clouds were sweeping swiftly down
back of them, and even as they looked a flash of
vivid lighting resembling a forked dagger shot
toward the earth, almost immediately succeeded
by another deep-toned burst of thunder.</p>

<p>“What do you say to that, George?” demanded
Josh, turning a triumphant face on
the other.</p>

<p>“Oh! seems like you hit the mark with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
guess,” admitted the other, “but then anybody
might one out of three. Besides, we
haven’t got the storm yet, have we? It may go
around us.”</p>

<p>“No danger of that,” declared Josh; “these
summer storms nearly always follow the channel
of a river. I’ve known ’em to pour down
pitchforks for half an hour on the water and
the other bank, and never a drop fall on me.
But we’ll get all the rain you want to see right
soon now.”</p>

<p>“I do hope it’ll cool the air some then,” complained
Buster, who being stouter than any of
his chums, must have suffered more in proportion
from the heat.</p>

<p>“What had we better do, Jack?” asked
George, surveying the black clouds uneasily.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad that we don’t happen to see any
cove where we could run in and stay,” replied
the pilot; “so on the whole I think we’d better
make a turn and head into the storm that’s
coming down the river.”</p>

<p>“That sounds good to me!” declared Josh,
instantly understanding the benefit such a
course would likely bring to them; “our cabin
is partly open in the rear, but well protected
forward. We can use that tarpaulin to cover
the well back here, and after all the storm won’t
last long. Swing her around, Jack, and edge in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
a bit closer to the shore while you’re about it.
The river is pretty wide right here.”</p>

<p>It seemed three times as wide to Buster just
then, as at any time before; but of course this
came from his suddenly awakened fears.</p>

<p>“How deep do you think it can be out here,
Josh?” he asked after another fearful rolling
crash of thunder had passed into rumblings in
the distance.</p>

<p>“Oh! a mile or so,” replied Josh, carelessly.</p>

<p>“Whee! then all I hope is we don’t get blown
over on our beam-ends, and have to swim for
it,” Buster was heard to say.</p>

<p>They had just managed to get the boat headed
up-stream when the squall struck them with
almost hurricane force. The water was lifted
and flung against the little boat with terrific
violence. Indeed, the boys working energetically
could hardly manage to fasten the stout
tarpaulin to the hooks by which it was meant
to be secured in an emergency like this, so as to
cover the open well at the stern.</p>

<p>The rain began to come down in wild gusts,
the wind howled around them, the boat rose and
fell frantically, and Jack had all he could do to
keep the plunging craft headed into the furious
storm.</p>

<p>It grew almost dark around them. Water
found entrance despite the cover, and the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
prepared to take a soaking. As they were not
made of salt, and had undergone many privations
and discomforts during other days, they
uttered no complaint. Indeed, Buster was telling
himself that it would be all right if they
only got through in safety; clothes could be
easily dried, but it was another thing to be
wrecked out on a raging river in a storm like
this.</p>

<p>The waves were mounting pretty high, so
that with every plunge they could tell that the
propeller was fighting the air, as it was hoisted
above the resisting water. This was what
alarmed Jack, for he knew the danger attending
such a sudden and constant change of
speed.</p>

<p>He tried the best he could to ease the strain
each time they rose and fell; but it was always
with an anxious heart that he listened to hear
if the propeller still continued to do its duty
after every mad plunge.</p>

<p>Minutes had passed, just how long a time
since the beginning of the storm none of the
boys could tell. Then all at once every one noticed
that they had ceased to progress steadily.
The noise of the churning propeller had also
ceased.</p>

<p>“We’re turning broadside to the blow,
Jack!” shouted Buster, although that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
hardly the case as yet, his fears magnifying the
danger.</p>

<p>“What happened, Jack?” roared Josh.</p>

<p>“Engine’s broken down, and we’re at the
mercy of the storm!” came the staggering
reply.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>THE SPORT OF THE ELEMENTS</small></h2>


<p>“Just what I expected!” exclaimed George,
when he heard what Jack had to say.</p>

<p>“Will the boat upset, do you think?” bellowed
Buster, as he fancied he could feel the
craft already tilting dangerously, so that he
“sidled” across to the other side of the crowded
little cabin.</p>

<p>“Oh! I hardly think it’ll be as bad as that,”
the commodore told him; “but while we’re
about it we’d better fasten on these life preservers!”</p>

<p>They had discovered half a dozen cork belts
under one of the lockers, and these Jack proceeded
to hastily throw out. Every fellow was
immediately engaged in trying to buckle one
about his person, well up under the arms.</p>

<p>The thunder bellowed at quick intervals, so
that talking could only be indulged in between
these outbursts. It was almost dark inside the
cabin of the rocking boat, and of course the
boys were all very much excited, not knowing
what was going to happen at the next minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“Be sure to get it up under your arms, Buster,”
warned Jack, while he worked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Josh, who could be sarcastic
even when confronted by such danger, “for if
the old thing slips down any it’ll keep your feet
out, and your head under water. Better put
two more on you, Buster, because you’re a
heavyweight, you know.”</p>

<p>Perhaps Josh was joking when he said this,
but Buster took it all solemnly enough.</p>

<p>“Guess I will, if the rest of you don’t need
’em!” he declared. “If you’re done fixin’ yours
Josh, <em>please</em> lend me a hand. I don’t seem able
to get the fastening the right way. Oh! we
nearly went over that time, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>“Keep still, Buster, and quit trying to balance
the boat!” urged George; “your weight
won’t matter a bean if she’s bound to turn turtle;
and you nearly smashed my foot that time,
you came down on it so hard. Talk to me about
a sportive elephant, it isn’t in the same class
with you when you get excited.”</p>

<p>“Here, I’ll try and fix you up, Buster, if only
you keep quiet a spell,” Josh told him, and between
the two mentors Buster resolved to bear
up and show a brave front.</p>

<p>Jack was peeping out as if hoping to see
some sign of the storm breaking. The boat
meanwhile was wallowing dreadfully, showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
that by degrees she must be turning sideways
to the waves and the wind, the latter still blowing
“great guns.”</p>

<p>A vivid flash came just when Jack had the
tarpaulin drawn aside, and made Buster give
a loud cry.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a scorcher!” he exclaimed; “I
thought I was struck at first.”</p>

<p>The speedy crash that followed drowned the
rest of his words.</p>

<p>“Any hope of its being over soon, Jack?” demanded
Josh, as soon as he could make himself
heard.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing that I could see,” came the
loud reply, for what with the howl of the wind
and the dash of the agitated waters against the
boat it was no easy matter to make oneself
heard. “All black around. You can’t see
twenty feet away for the rain and the gloom.”</p>

<p>“Jack, do you happen to know whether
there’s any rapids or falls along the Danube?”
asked George presently.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure about it,” replied the other;
“seems to me I did hear some talk about rapids
or falls or something, though it may have been
about the river away up above Vienna.”</p>

<p>Buster at that found himself possessed with
a new cause for alarm. He pictured Niagara
Falls, and the powerboat plunging over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
beetling brink, with four boys he knew full
well fastened in its interior, helpless victims.
Then as the mood changed he could see Whirlpool
Rapids below the falls, through which no
ordinary boat had been known to pass safely,
but always emerged in splinters, after buffeting
the half-hidden sharp-pointed rocks, and
urged on by the frightful current.</p>

<p>“Listen! I thought I heard a distant roaring
sound just then that might be the falls,
fellows!” Buster broke out with.</p>

<p>Although the others all suspected that it was
only the result of a lively imagination that
caused him to say this, at the same time they
could not help straining their hearing to ascertain
whether there could be any truth in it.</p>

<p>“You fooled yourself that time, Buster,”
announced George finally, and with a vein of
positive relief in his voice; “it must have been
the rain coming down like a cloud-burst, or else
the wind tearing through some trees ashore.”</p>

<p>The action of the boat continued to cause
more or less anxiety. Frequently when the
wind struck savagely on the counter of the
wallowing craft it would careen over so far
that even Jack feared a catastrophe was impending.</p>

<p>Everything conspired to cause alarm&mdash;the
darkness, the heavy crash of thunder, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
blinding flashes of lightning that stabbed the
gloom so suddenly, and the possibility of the
boat turning turtle.</p>

<p>In the midst of this Jack was seen to be
crawling out of the cover.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” shouted Josh.</p>

<p>“All of us have forgotten that we’ve got an
anchor forward,” Jack told him; “I’m going
to drop it over. It may take hold; and anyway
it’s bound to keep our head into the storm
by dragging!”</p>

<p>“Let me help you, Jack!” added Josh with
his usual impulsiveness.</p>

<p>“You may come along, but no one else,” he
was told.</p>

<p>Of course, that was aimed primarily at Buster,
for Jack could not forget how clumsy the
fat chum always proved himself to be; and the
chances were that he would manage to fall
overboard did he attempt to crawl along the
slippery sloping deck.</p>

<p>Once outside and Josh realized what a difficult
thing it was going to be to get forward to
where the anchor might be found. The little
boat rolled and tossed like a chip on the angry
seas. Josh felt almost dizzy with the motion,
but he shut his teeth grimly together and resolved
to stick it out to the end. If Jack could
stand it surely he should be able to do the same.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Besides, he would sooner die almost than let
George see him show the white feather.</p>

<p>“Get a good hold before you move each
time,” called Jack in his ear; “and better grab
me if you find yourself going!”</p>

<p>That was just like Jack’s generous nature;
he thought nothing of the added risk he was
assuming when he gave Josh this advice.</p>

<p>Josh would never be apt to forget that exciting
experience as long as he lived. Except
when the lightning came it was as impossible
to see anything as though they were in the
midst of a dark night; and even then all they
could detect was what seemed to be a wall of
gray fog enveloping them on every side, with
the white-capped waves leaping and tossing
like hungry wolves around them.</p>

<p>Of course, both boys were immediately
drenched, but of this they thought nothing.
Both had their coats off at the time, on account
of the afternoon heat, which turned out to be a
lucky thing for them, since their movements
were apt to be less fettered and confined in
consequence.</p>

<p>Foot by foot they made their way forward.
Jack’s advice to always retain one grip until
the other hand could take hold of something
ahead saved Josh more than once from being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
thrown overboard. A little recklessness would
have cost him dear in a case like that.</p>

<p>Finally Jack seemed to have gained his end,
for he was bending down over the anchor when
a flash of lightning enabled the other boy to see
him again. Josh, determined to have a hand in
casting the mudhook overboard, hastened to
join him.</p>

<p>“The end of the cable is fast all right, is it,
Jack?” he shouted, as together they took hold
of the rusty iron anchor.</p>

<p>“Yes. I made sure of that before we
started, and tested the cable in the bargain,”
he was instantly assured.</p>

<p>It was a good thing some one had been so
careful, for Josh himself had evidently not
given the matter a single thought.</p>

<p>“Look out not to get a leg tangled in the
rope, Josh!” shouted Jack.</p>

<p>“I will, all right!” the other replied, knowing
that in such an event he would be dragged
overboard like a flash.</p>

<p>So the anchor was let go.</p>

<p>There was no result until the whole of the
cable had been paid out. Jack waited anxiously
to see what followed, though he knew
fairly well it would steady the drifting boat
and turn the bow into the storm again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Both of them felt the sudden jerk that announced
the expected event.</p>

<p>“She’s turning right away, Jack!” bellowed
Josh, trying to make himself heard above the
heavy boom of the thunder’s growl.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt on that score, for
already the motions of the runaway motorboat
seemed to be much less violent. Jack believed
his scheme was going to be a success, and
it pleased him to know that his wetting would
not have been taken for nothing.</p>

<p>They lingered no longer, but started back
toward the stern. It was not quite so difficult
now to creep along the slippery deck, holding
on to the cabin roof, and finally reaching the
open well in the stern. A head was in sight,
showing that one of the anxious chums could
not rest easy until he learned what the result
of the venture had been.</p>

<p>“You must have done it, fellows!” exclaimed
Buster, for it was no other than the stout boy
who had thrust his head out like a tortoise,
“because she rides so much easier now. I knew
Jack’d manage it if anybody could.”</p>

<p>Drenched as they were, the two boys had to
drop down under the tarpaulin. After all,
that was a minor matter, since by their bold
action they had warded off what might have
turned out to be a grave disaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let her blow and thunder all she wants to
now,” said Josh triumphantly; “we’ve got the
anchor trailing from the bow, and that’s going
to keep her nose in the wind. I’ve read how a
vessel nearly going down in a hurricane has
been saved by making a storm anchor out of
hatches, or anything else that will float, and
towing the same behind to keep the ship steady.
That’s what <em>we</em> did, you see.”</p>

<p>Josh was more than glad now he had insisted
on accompanying the commodore in attempting
to carry out his hazardous undertaking.
It would give him an opportunity to
swell with importance whenever the deed was
mentioned, and to use the magical word “we”
in speaking of the adventure. What boy is
there who does not like to feel that he personally
partook of the danger when brave things
were undertaken and accomplished?</p>

<p>After that they settled down to wait. The
storm must surely come to an end before a
great while, and as they were now moving at
less than one-half the mad pace they had been
going before that drag had been instituted, it
seemed perfectly safe even to Buster.</p>

<p>“All I hope for now is that we don’t run
afoul of some half-sunken rock, or it may be a
snag!” Josh was heard to say.</p>

<p>“We do know there are snags floating along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
because you remember I struck one only yesterday,”
ventured Buster, referring, of course,
to the log which, by catching his trailing fish
hook, had dragged him overboard.</p>

<p>“Not much danger of that,” Jack assured
them; “they keep a pretty clear channel over
here, it seems, even if we haven’t met steamboats
on the river like you would on the Mississippi.
Given another ten minutes or so and I
think we’ll see the break in the storm we expect.
It can hardly last much longer now.”</p>

<p>“Must have done some damage ashore, too,
boys?” suggested George.</p>

<p>“So long as it hasn’t killed off all the chickens,
so we can’t get any more eggs, that doesn’t
really concern us, I s’pose,” said Buster, not
meaning to be unfeeling in the least, but just
then that seemed to be in the nature of a calamity
in his mind.</p>

<p>Slowly the time passed, but the boys were
soon delighted to discover that there was actually
a slackening up of the elements that had
combined to make such a furious discord. The
thunder became less boisterous, the wind lulled
perceptibly, and even the waves had lost much
of their force.</p>

<p>Jack, taking an observation, made an important
discovery, and followed it with an announcement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
that gave his comrades considerable
pleasure.</p>

<p>“There’s a break in the storm clouds over
there in the west, boys, and I guess we’ve got to
the end of this trouble!”</p>

<p>“With no damage done except a wetting for
two of us,” added Josh, trying to act as though
that counted for next to nothing, considering
the benefits that had probably sprung from the
work of Jack and himself.</p>

<p>“Why, it seems to me the rain has let up,
too, Jack!” exclaimed Buster, forcing his head
through the opening in the tarpaulin cover of
the well.</p>

<p>“In a few minutes more we can get rid of
this old thing and breathe free once more,”
Jack told him.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure I’ll be mighty glad,” said
Buster, “because I’m nearly stewed as it is,
with the heat below here; and that breeze feels
mighty good to me. It won’t be near as warm
after this storm, that’s sure.”</p>

<p>“Like as not, Buster,” advised Josh, shivering
a little because of his wet condition, “we’ll
all be frozen stiff before an hour goes by.
Queer things happen over in this Danube country,
I’m told.”</p>

<p>“Rats! You can’t scare me, Josh,” Buster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
immediately informed him; “course, since
you’re all wet through and through <em>you</em> might
freeze, but not a healthy specimen like me.
This time we’ll have to make a fire for you
other fellows, if we can find enough dry wood
to burn, that is.”</p>

<p>Jack’s prediction was soon fulfilled. The
break in the storm clouds grew rapidly in magnitude
until quite a large sized patch of blue
sky became visible. They soon had the tarpaulin
dragged on top of the cabin roof to dry
out; and when the sun appeared the pair who
had been drenched took positive delight in
sprawling there and letting the warm rays
start drying their garments on them.</p>

<p>“Well, seems like we got through that scrape
O. K.,” ventured Buster; “but we’re not yet
out of the woods by a big lot. We’ve got a
broken engine on our hands, and no means of
fixing the same, even if we knew how to do it.
What’s to be done now, Commodore Jack?”</p>

<p>Somehow the others always thought to give
Jack his full title when relying on him to get
them out of a scrape. But Jack let this significant
fact pass, for he knew these three chums
from the ground up, and could not hold a single
thing against any one of them. And, as usual,
he had a remedy ready for every disease.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>THE HUNGARIAN MOB</small></h2>


<p>“There’s only one thing we can do,” Jack
told them, “which is to work the boat along
closer to the western shore. Before long, unless
my map of the river is all wrong, we ought
to strike a town by the name of Mohaca, a railroad
place situated on a sharp bend of the
Danube, and there must be some one in that
town who can do the necessary repairs to our
engine, if we hold over half a day.”</p>

<p>The others admitted that the plan proposed
by their leader sounded good to them. And
accordingly they set to work first of all to get
the trailing anchor aboard, so that their progress
would be delayed no longer.</p>

<p>Buster was much relieved. Besides, it was
Josh who was saturated to the skin now, and
when one means to be cheerful it counts for
considerable “whose ox is gored,” as Buster
liked to put it.</p>

<p>Still he felt sorry when he saw Josh shivering,
for the air had become suddenly quite cool
after the passing of the storm, and insisted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
wrapping a blanket about the slim boy.</p>

<p>All of them kept watch for signs of the town
below. The afternoon was wearing on very
fast now, and they hoped to arrive before sunset.
It might be a difficult matter to find the
machinist they wanted if they reached the town
on the bank of the Danube after darkness had
set in.</p>

<p>“I reckon it’s at that bend below there,” said
Jack; “if you look sharp you can see the sun
glinting from what looks to me like a church
steeple, with a cross on the same.”</p>

<p>“You hit it that time, Jack,” asserted Josh,
“because that’s just what it is. For one I’ll be
glad to get where we can have a fire and dry
out.”</p>

<p>They were compelled to work pretty hard in
order to get the boat over close to the shore
where the town stood. The current seemed to
run in a contrary direction, and did its best to
frustrate their efforts.</p>

<p>Jack, however, remembering many other
times when they had been aboard motorboats
that acted queerly, or else broke down, had seen
to it that there was a push-pole lashed to the
side of the craft. The river at this point
proved to be comparatively shallow, so that it
was easily possible to reach bottom.</p>

<p>By changing hands, and each one having a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
turn, they kept where they wanted to go, and in
this way made the town.</p>

<p>It did not differ from other places they had
been seeing along the Danube, and after the
storm it looked rather subdued. In the morning
they would find the customary amount of
life in the place, together with the usual display
of soldiers’ uniforms, Jack did not doubt
in the least.</p>

<p>As they were passing slowly along in search
of some place where they might hope to have
their broken-down engine repaired on the following
day, as well as a harbor of refuge for
the coming night, loud cheers drew their attention
to the railroad which ran close to the river
bank.</p>

<p>“It’s only another train-load of troops going
to the front!” announced Josh, as they saw
numerous heads thrust from the windows of
the carriages, together with wildly waving
hands.</p>

<p>“They think it’s a picnic to start with,” said
George, “but before long they’ll sing a different
tune, I guess; that is, those who live
through the first battle. In these days of quick-firing
guns and the terrible shells, the chances
a fellow has of coming back home are mighty
small. No soldiering for me if I know myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all hot air you’re giving us,
George,” scoffed Josh. “You know mighty
well that if our country was in danger, and you
were old enough, you’d enlist right away. So
would we all of us, as well as Herb and Andy
at home. You’ve got your faults, George, as
all of us have, but being a coward isn’t one of
them by a long shot.”</p>

<p>George did not make any reply to this
speech, but smiled as though he felt rather
pleased to know even Josh had such a good
opinion of his fighting abilities.</p>

<p>The long train with its shouting crowds
passed from sight. Evidently these troops
were headed for the Servian border, and expected
to see warm service there, fighting
against the brave little country that had long
since won its independence from the Turks.</p>

<p>“I think I see what we’re wanting to find,”
remarked Jack presently.</p>

<p>“It’s the usual boatyard you find in nearly
all river towns,” added Josh; “and we ought
to be able to make arrangements for having
our engine looked over and repaired in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“Make your minds easy on that score,” advised
George, calmly enough; “for even if we
don’t run across a machinist who can do the
job, trust me to tackle it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“What! you?” ejaculated Buster.</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded George, as though
aggrieved that any one should for a moment
question his ability in that line. “Haven’t I
taken the engine of my Wireless to pieces
many a time and put it together again?”</p>

<p>“That’s right, you have,” spoke up Josh,
“because you never could let well enough alone,
but must be monkeying around your engine all
the time. That’s why Jack insisted in the beginning
of this voyage that you were to be a
passenger and let him act as pilot and engineer.”</p>

<p>“But the engine’s broken down, isn’t it?”
demanded George.</p>

<p>“Sure it has,” Josh admitted, “but that was
a sheer accident, and you didn’t have a thing
to do with it.”</p>

<p>“There’s no reason to believe we’ll get left
about finding a machinist here,” Jack remarked,
to calm the troubled waters. “I think
that sign tells us as much. But we’ll soon
know.”</p>

<p>They managed to push the boat inside the enclosure.
Here they found a number of river
craft of various types, and Jack noticed that
among them were several launches, from which
fact he judged that the man did all kinds of
general repairing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>A short time later they landed and found the
owner of the shop. He could understand English,
fortunately enough, so they were able to
make a bargain with him. Doubtless he must
have charged them an exorbitant price, for
upon their accepting his terms he showed them
unusual courtesy, even telling them to push the
boat inside his house, where he could get to
work at the engine in the morning.</p>

<p>He also informed the boys that if they chose
to sleep aboard they were at perfect liberty to
do so. Should it storm again they would have
the benefit of a roof over their heads; and they
could cook their supper at the fire he would
leave in the forge.</p>

<p>Buster immediately declared it would be a
jolly thing all around.</p>

<p>“You know we do feel more or less cramped
aboard our boat,” he went on to remark, with
considerable eagerness. “And if you say the
word, why, I’ll take my blanket and camp out
here on the floor. There are plenty of chips to
make a soft bed, even if they don’t smell as
sweet as hemlock browse such as we have at
home.”</p>

<p>“And another thing,” added Josh, “Jack
and myself can get nice and dry at the fire here
in the forge. I think the man must have noticed
that we’d been soaked.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and he soaked us some more in the
bargain,” complained George, “according to
the price we agreed to pay him for the easy job
of mending a broken engine. See, you might
have saved all that money if you’d had enough
confidence in me to let me run the job.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps!” said Josh dryly, and there was
such a world of meaning in that one word as
pronounced by him that George immediately
fell silent, not caring to bring about another
verbal controversy.</p>

<p>The owner of the boatyard and shop was
certainly very kind in allowing those who were
perfect strangers to him to remain over night
there. He must have seen by looking at the
faces of the four boys that they were worthy
of trust. It was not everybody whom he would
grant such a favor to, and Jack told his chums
they had reason to feel quite proud of the fact.</p>

<p>It was by this time getting quite dark. The
man had lighted a lamp for them, which served
to dispel the gloom in the shop’s interior. Josh
was already using the bellows in order to blow
the dying fire into new life. When the heat
became noticeable he and Jack proceeded to
warm up. By degrees they found that this
steaming process dried their clothes admirably.
Buster could tell them how efficient it
had been in his own case, only that Buster was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
now impatient for them to get through, so he
could have the red bed of coals for the purpose
of cooking supper.</p>

<p>At the time the proprietor of the boatyard
went away Jack had stepped outside the door
with him. As he expected, he found that the
shop faced on a street running close to the river
itself.</p>

<p>As they had laid in plenty of provisions at
Budapest, there was really no necessity for any
of them to wander around the town. If the
boys exhibited any curiosity in that respect,
Jack meant to dampen their zeal by telling
them there might be some danger of strangers
being eyed with suspicion in these exciting
days, and that it would be safest to stay at the
shop.</p>

<p>Besides, there could be no telling just when
the repairs would be finished, for, after all, the
damage was apt to be slight; and in this event
they would want to be on the move with as little
delay as possible.</p>

<p>Bumpus was soon in his glory. It had indeed
been a long while since they had enjoyed
the privilege of preparing a meal over such a
fine fire as the blacksmith forge afforded them.
Besides, the glowing coals seemed so much
nicer than ordinary smoking wood; as Bumpus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
said, it saved the cook’s back considerable, in
that he did not have to bend down so much.</p>

<p>They found something that answered for a
table, and by the light of the lamp so kindly
loaned by the owner they ate their supper. No
matter what it consisted of, for there is no time
to go into particulars&mdash;at least it had a
“homey” taste to it, and brought back to their
minds numerous other meals which had accompanied
their various cruises down American
rivers, through the Great Lakes, and among
the islands of the Florida coast.</p>

<p>It seemed very quiet down by the river. If
the town itself was booming with the spirit of
war, the boys heard very little of it while they
sat around chatting, after partaking of the
meal Bumpus provided.</p>

<p>Once George sauntered over to the door that
led to the street and looked out, but he did not
venture forth. When he came back Josh, of
course, wanted to know what he had heard.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much,” the other replied with
a yawn. “There’s considerable noise up above,
and perhaps some soldiers are getting ready to
go away. You know they make an awful lot of
fuss over here when the boys are off for the
war.”</p>

<p>“So far as that goes, they do it everywhere,”
remarked Jack. “I remember plainly hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
my folks telling all that happened in our town
in ninety-eight, when the war with Spain broke
out. Of course, all of us were kids then, babies
in fact, and we knew nothing about it; but I
take it there were lots of exciting things happening
day after day, as trains passed through.
One country doesn’t differ a great deal from
another, when you come to take notice.”</p>

<p>“I hope you took pains to put up that stout
bar again, George, after you shut the double
doors?” remarked Bumpus. “Not that I expect
we’ll be troubled with unwelcome visitors
in the shape of thieves while we’re roosting
here, but you know it’s a heap nicer to know
everything’s lovely and the goose hangs high.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t borrow any trouble about that
bar, Buster,” George assured him. “Sure I
put it back, just like I found it. I reckon the
owner uses it when he’s working in here behind
closed doors and doesn’t want to be disturbed.
You know he locked the small door before going
away. It’s all right, Buster, so let your
dear timid soul rest in peace.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not that I’m afraid,” asserted the
other indignantly; “honest, George, I only
mentioned the matter as a simple precaution.
Jack here might have done the same, given a
little more time. You ought to know me better
than that, George.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The boat lay tied up in the basin inside the
shed. Back of it was a water gate, which had
also been closed and fastened by the owner before
departing. Surrounded as they were by
all the tools of a boat repairer’s trade, the boys
felt as though they were in strange company.
Possibly some of these same tools were built
along different lines from what they might
have found in the same sort of an establishment
in the States.</p>

<p>For quite some time the four chums sat there
and talked over various things of interest. Of
course, these as a general rule had some connection
with their own fortunes. Many questions
were asked and answered, by one or another,
as the case might be, although as a rule
it was Jack to whom most of them were addressed.
The whole scheme of a cruise down
the Danube had originated with Jack, and for
this reason, as well as others, the remaining
three boys looked to him to find answers to the
many puzzling enigmas that faced them.</p>

<p>Jack was fully qualified to assume this task,
and it was seldom they were ever able to
“stump” him with a twister.</p>

<p>So the time passed on, and, judging from the
repeated way in which some of the motorboat
boys were yawning without even putting up a
hand to hide the gap, it became evident that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
they could not remain awake much longer.</p>

<p>Indeed, Jack himself felt pretty drowsy, and
was just about to propose that the meeting adjourn
<i>sine die</i>, so that each could prepare his
cot for the night, just as he saw fit, when something
occurred to interfere with this peaceful
scheme.</p>

<p>“Listen! Seems to me that hollerin’s coming
closer to us,” exclaimed Josh.</p>

<p>“Sure it is,” added George, which was
pretty conclusive evidence pointing that way,
because as a rule he would have questioned it
before giving in.</p>

<p>“There’s a crowd coming,” said Jack
quietly.</p>

<p>“More like an angry mob, it sounds to me,”
muttered Josh.</p>

<p>“Say, you don’t think for a minute, do you,”
cried Buster, “that they know about us being
hidden in this coop, and mean to interview the
bunch, perhaps shoot us for Servian spies?”</p>

<p>“Oh, hardly as bad as that,” Jack went on
to say, seeking to calm the excited Buster;
“they may pass by and never bother us at all.
Perhaps some soldiers are going along to a
place of meeting, where they expect to entrain
for the front.”</p>

<p>“Anyway, we’ll soon know the worst,” declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Josh, “because they’re nearly up to the
shop by now.”</p>

<p>The shouts outside had an angry and insistent
ring about them that Jack did not like.
Then came a series of heavy and imperative
knocks on the closed shop doors!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>CLEVERLY DONE</small></h2>


<p>“My stars! it’s us they’re after, fellows!”
Buster was heard to gurgle, when the knocks
ceased as suddenly as they had begun.</p>

<p>No one had to be told that, for they all knew
it just as well as Buster. George turned an
anxious look on Josh; and then, perhaps unconsciously
placing their hopes on their leader,
both of them wheeled to face Jack.</p>

<p>“I knew we’d be sorry if ever we tried stopping
over at one of these ratty little towns,”
muttered George.</p>

<p>“But there they start to knocking again!”
exclaimed Josh. “If we don’t do something,
and pretty quick at that, they’ll start to pulling
this shanty down over our heads, even if
it is made of stones.”</p>

<p>Jack had to think fast. He knew Josh spoke
the truth, and that so far as offering resistance
went they were practically helpless against the
mob. He could easily imagine how in some
manner suspicion had been excited against the
four young strangers stopping over night at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the river town. One word would lead to another
in these exciting times, until all sorts of
extravagant surmises must result; and finally
some bold spirit must have suggested that they
proceed to the boathouse and drag the unknown
parties out, to question, perhaps hang
them.</p>

<p>So far as trying to escape was concerned, it
seemed equally hopeless. Besides the double
door there was also the small one, which the
proprietor had securely locked before leaving
them. Both led to the street.</p>

<p>To be sure, there were the water gates, but
to leave in that way must necessitate abandoning
their motorboat, something the boys would
be loth to do. Further than this, there was no
small boat handy, even if they could manage
to get it out on the river without being noticed
and pursued.</p>

<p>As to attempting to swim off, that was impossible,
since they could not make any headway
with their clothes on, and leaving these behind
was not to be considered for a minute.</p>

<p>So Jack quickly decided that the only thing
left for them was to throw open the double
doors and trust to their customary good luck
to make friends with the clamorous mob without.</p>

<p>“I’m going to open up, fellows,” he told the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
others. “You keep back of me, and say nothing
unless I ask you to speak. Leave it all to
me to manage.”</p>

<p>“You just bet we will, Jack,” assented Josh.</p>

<p>“I should say yes,” Buster hastily added.</p>

<p>“It’s a risky thing to do, Jack,” remarked
George, “but seems that we haven’t got much
of a choice. We’re between the devil and the
deep sea. Go ahead, then, and let’s see how our
luck holds good.”</p>

<p>Jack waited no longer. Indeed, it would
have been dangerous to have held the clamorous
crowd in waiting much longer, for their
pounding on the door had assumed a more
threatening phase, several having taken it
upon themselves to pick up heavy stones, with
which they started to beat the woodwork furiously,
while all manner of loud cries arose.</p>

<p>Suddenly the double doors were swung wide
open. The outcries ceased as if by magic.
Jack, looking out, saw that fully fifty people
stood in the moonlit street. Most of them were
men and boys, though a sprinkling of women
could also be seen.</p>

<p>They were typical Hungarians, just such
people as one would expect to meet in a river
town along the lower Danube. Some were
flourishing what appeared to be clubs, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
whole aspect of the mob looked threatening indeed.</p>

<p>It required considerable nerve to calmly face
this crowd, but Jack actually smiled, and
waved his hand in friendly greeting, while
Buster held his breath in very awe, and the
other two trembled a little between excitement
and alarm.</p>

<p>One burly man in the front of the mob called
out harshly. Jack could not for a certainty
know what he said, but it was easy to guess he
must be demanding who they were, where they
came from, and what they were doing in this
part of the country in these perilous times.</p>

<p>So Jack, waving his hand to entreat silence,
called out:</p>

<p>“Is there any one here who can talk English!”</p>

<p>Somehow his question created considerable
surprise. Evidently the crowd had suspected
that they were Serbians or natives of Montenegro,
both of which states at the time were
antagonistic to Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p>Several voices were heard announcing that
they could understand and speak the English
language. Jack swept his eyes around to see
who these persons were, and, discovering that
one of them stood in the front rank of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
crowd, he pointed at the man as he went on to
say:</p>

<p>“Please push your way up here. We will
tell you everything you want to know, and you
can explain to your friends.”</p>

<p>The man did so, looking very important.
Perhaps that was the first time in all his life
that he had been called upon to act in such a
capacity as interpreter, and he felt as though
placed upon a pedestal.</p>

<p>“Now, if you will please give me a chance,
all of you,” continued Jack, “I will with the
greatest pleasure tell everything. In the first
place, we are not, as you think, English boys,
but Americans. Of course, you know about
America, for we have many thousands of good
Hungarians over there working with us, who
send millions on millions of dollars back home
every year for the old folks. Tell them what I
have just said, will you?”</p>

<p>The man had listened intently. He collected
his wits, and then, turning around so as to face
the rest, commenced speaking. At the same
time he made good use of both hands, in the
Hungarian fashion, to emphasize his points.</p>

<p>Some few of the more unruly made remarks
among themselves as he proceeded, but on the
whole the crowd listened intently. It was already
apparent to Jack that he had gone about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the business in the right way, and had succeeded
in making a good impression.</p>

<p>He had read recently in a paper, whether it
were true or not, that the tens of thousands of
Hungarians in the United States, men in the
mines and working on public improvements,
and girls in service, sent back home during the
course of a year as much as a hundred and fifty
million dollars. Even if a third of that amount
came across the sea it could be understood that
the people of the dual monarchy must have a
very tender spot in their hearts for <em>America</em>,
where so many of their compatriots were making
big wages and happy.</p>

<p>“Keep it moving, Jack,” whispered Josh.
“I tell you they’re already on the run. Lay it
on thick, and don’t spare the adjectives. They
like to hear things praised up to the skies. And
say something nice about old Francis Joseph,
because, you know, they worship him.”</p>

<p>“Cut it out, Josh,” growled George; “leave
Jack alone to run this game, can’t you?”</p>

<p>The man had by now finished telling what
Jack had said to him. He again turned with a
look of expectancy on his face, waiting for the
second “installment of the story,” as Josh
afterwards called it.</p>

<p>“We are American boys,” continued Jack,
“who have come over here on a vacation. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
our own country we own three motorboats,
with which we often cruise up and down the
Mississippi River and others. So, having
heard so much about your beautiful blue Danube,
we made up our minds to spend a month
or six weeks voyaging down it. This boat does
not belong to us. We hired it from a man in a
town part-way between Vienna and Budapest.
We can show you the paper both parties signed
proving how we paid a certain sum in advance
for the use of it until we reached the Black Sea.
Now tell them all that, please, while I get our
American passports ready to show you, as well
as letters we have received from our home
while in Budapest.”</p>

<p>It took the interpreter a long time to translate
all this. He struggled heroically to master
every detail, though Jack feared he might get
mixed more or less in his endeavor to find
words to express the English meaning.</p>

<p>The crowd listened intently.</p>

<p>It would have been amusing to watch their
faces as seen in the bright moonlight had the
danger element been lacking. As it was, the
boys were still on the anxious seat, not knowing
“which way the cat would jump.”</p>

<p>Jack was the exception, it may be said. He
felt that his tactics and the frank way he was
taking the crowd into his confidence had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
made a favorable impression upon most
of the men. They in turn would be apt to suppress
any of the more boisterous spirits who
might feel like getting out of bounds.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, it was as much the manner of
Jack Stormways as what he said that worked
this change in the feelings of the populace. No
one of intelligence could very well look upon
his smiling face and believe ill of him.</p>

<p>By the time the man had managed to translate
all that second batch of explanations to his
fellows Jack was ready for him again. He had
meanwhile collected from the other three their
passports, properly vised through the efforts
of the American consul in Vienna, and also
several letters addressed to the general delivery
at Budapest, with the American stamps
and postmarks to prove where they had come
from.</p>

<p>These papers he now handed to the man who
could speak and read English. Each one Jack
opened and explained, after asking Josh to
fetch the lamp forward so that its light could
be utilized.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the crowd listened and pushed
and gaped, some exchanging low comments;
but Buster was delighted to see that the threatening
gestures had stopped. From this he felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
that Stormways’ stock was rising fast and
would soon bull the market.</p>

<p>It took a long time to go over the four passports
with their seals, and then read extracts
from the letters. The man spoke several times,
asking questions, which proved that he meant
to conduct his examination in a thorough manner.
Jack was in truth pleased to find that he
had to deal with so intelligent a party, for the
travelers had really nothing to conceal.</p>

<p>He even mentioned about the three Hungarian
officers who had overtaken them some
miles below Budapest, coming in a speed
launch, and how they had parted the best of
friends after looking the boys over.</p>

<p>Seeing that the crowd was becoming impatient,
Jack cut his explanations short and
asked that the interpreter make his report to
his friends. He had taken the advice of
shrewd Josh, and managed to speak highly of
the aged emperor; while this may have been
done artfully as a stroke of diplomacy, Jack
really knew nothing but good of Francis Joseph,
of whom he had often read, so that he did
not feel that he was attempting any deception.</p>

<p>Still holding the sheaf of passports, the man
started to harangue the crowd. He seemed to
improve as he gained new confidence, and Jack
saw that he was something of a crude born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
orator, able to sway others by the force of his
will and words.</p>

<p>Jack believed the best part of their luck lay
in having picked on this particular man. Another
might have bungled things and made
them worse than they were originally.</p>

<p>It took a very long time to explain about the
papers, the letters and everything else. Jack
even heard the man mention the emperor’s
name, and from this judged that he was repeating
what the boy had said in order to prove
that the four strangers from America were favorable
to the Austrian side of the controversy.</p>

<p>“He’s got ’em whipped to a standstill,
Jack,” muttered Josh in the ear of the other.
“They’ll do whatever he tells ’em, you mark
me. I guess I can read all the signs if I can’t
understand the lingo.”</p>

<p>Jack himself believed the same thing. He
no longer felt his heart heavy within him, with
the prospect of having their fine cruise broken
off and themselves thrown into some prison,
from which it would take all the efforts of the
American Ambassador to release them.</p>

<p>Before the man who was speaking had finished
there were desertions from the mob, possibly
some of those more ardent spirits who
had hoped to help hang a suspected Serbian
spy and were grievously disappointed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>When the speaker closed with what seemed
to be a fervent peroration there followed a
general shout and much waving of hands. Jack
caught the one word America, and judged that
the cheers were intended for his native land,
for surely many of these people had good reason
to think of the haven of the oppressed as a
Paradise flowing with gold, milk and honey.</p>

<p>Then the mob began to disintegrate. A number
who could speak English came crowding
around. They wished to shake hands with the
four stout-hearted lads who were not to be deterred
from continuing their hazardous voyage
down the Danube by the mere fact that hostilities
had begun, and that there must be heavy
firing between the Austrian batteries and monitors
and the hostile forces in Belgrade, the
Serbian capital, situated on the southern bank
of the river.</p>

<p>By degrees they went away, after giving this
popular demonstration. Somehow Buster
changed his mind completely after seeing how
those same shouting men could turn into
friends. He even remarked afterwards that
he thought the Hungarians were a warm-hearted
race, and that he was growing to like
them immensely; though when he first saw the
mob he believed they were a lot of cutthroats
eager for the lives of helpless American boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>The interpreter was the last to go. Jack was
seen to shake hands heartily with him for the
third time ere saying good-by.</p>

<p>“I reckon now, Jack,” remarked George, as
they closed the double doors once more, shutting
out the bright moonlight, “you slipped a
bill of some kind in that fine fellow’s hand the
last time you said good-by to him?”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that, George,” retorted
the other; “if I did, that’s between the two of
us, and nobody need know about it. It was
worth ten times as much just to see the way he
swayed that crowd. From howling at us they
came to cheer us, and a good deal of the change
was due to his oratory.”</p>

<p>“As for me,” piped up Buster, with a great
sigh of relief, “I never will forget this experience.
There was a time at first when I thought
of having my head put on a pike and carried in
a procession around town, just like the mob
used to do in the French Revolution; or, if it
wasn’t that, I expected they’d get a rope and
swing us all up, Wild Western way. I tell you
I’m shaking yet from being so anxious about
you fellows.”</p>

<p>Josh and George laughed at hearing this,
and the whole of them went back to their seats.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>UNDER FIRE ON THE RIVER</small></h2>


<p>Later on the four boys made themselves as
comfortable as the conditions allowed, and
tried to settle down for the night. Buster had
carried out his words, and managed to gather
enough shavings to make a soft bed on the
floor, using his blanket to cover the same. Josh
imitated his example, but the others were satisfied
to occupy their old places in the boat.</p>

<p>None of them slept soundly, and for good
reasons. The recent excitement made such an
impression on their minds that they could not
for a long time stop thinking about the visit of
the mob.</p>

<p>Then again there was always the chance that
some of the wilder spirits might think they had
been cheated out of some fun, and come back in
the small hours of the night to renew the
trouble.</p>

<p>Several times, when some sound was heard
that at another time would hardly have been
noticed, one or more of the seeming sleepers
would raise his head to listen, proving that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
sleep had been remote at the time. Buster in
particular was uneasy, and even after he managed
to get asleep Josh declared he tossed
about and muttered to himself at a fierce rate.</p>

<p>But, after all, their fears proved groundless.
The townspeople had accepted them at their
face value, and did not mean to bother the
strangers again. No one came prowling around
the boatshop during the balance of the night;
and with the arrival of dawn the boys were all
up, ready to cook breakfast and clear the shop
so that the proprietor could get busy.</p>

<p>They had a simple meal, only coffee, boiled
eggs and buttered toast; but every one ate all
he wished, so there was no complaints coming.</p>

<p>Then came the owner of the boatyard and
shop, who was greatly surprised when he
learned what had happened on the preceding
night. He seemed indignant at first, but
calmed down when he heard how the mob had
changed from enemies into friends after finding
that the boys were from America.</p>

<p>He told Jack that he could give a surmise as
to what had prompted the attack. Strangely
enough, it concerned that story of the four
desperate young Serbians who, according to
accounts, were said to have started for Vienna
with the avowed intention of depriving Austria-Hungary
of their beloved old emperor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
just as some other wild spirits had murdered
the heir apparent and his wife.</p>

<p>Apparently this story was believed by all
who heard it. Those Serbians were getting
very bold of late, and nothing seemed to be beyond
them. They were also earning the mortal
hatred of the Hungarians, Jack could see.</p>

<p>When the assistant worker arrived the two
of them began to overhaul the engine of the
powerboat. George stood around every minute
of the time and watched, as well as asked innumerable
questions. The others, however,
made him promise not to offer to render the
least assistance. They knew George’s failings,
and feared that if he once got to pottering with
that engine it was surely doomed.</p>

<p>Apparently the man knew his business thoroughly.
Jack, after seeing how he went at
matters, felt sure the trouble would soon be
located and remedied, when they might go on
their way rejoicing.</p>

<p>It was about ten o’clock when the engine was
started up and responded handsomely. Buster
gave a whoop of delight, while Josh swung his
hat above his head, and the others also smiled
in satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Everything is lovely and the goose hangs
high!” Josh announced, as he jumped up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
chinned himself against a handy rafter of the
low shed.</p>

<p>“We can all see that without your telling
us, Josh,” George chuckled.</p>

<p>Of course, every one was in a fine humor
now. Their stop had not proven so serious
after all, since they had only lost a few hours.
As to the sum asked by the machinist, that did
not bother them at all, since there was plenty
more where that money came from.</p>

<p>As there was now nothing to delay them,
they said good-by to their friend of the boatyard
and were soon moving down the river
again, delighted at their good fortune.</p>

<p>“Another odd experience, that’s all,” sang
Josh, as they took their last look back at the
town on the point before turning another bend
that would hide it entirely from view.</p>

<p>“But at one time, I tell you, it promised to be
pretty serious,” Buster asserted. “We’ve got
one asset, though, that never fails us.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked George.</p>

<p>“The Stormways luck!” laughed the fat
chum. “In fair weather and foul, and through
storm and stress it can always be depended on
to bridge over all difficulties and drag us out of
every old mud-hole or swamp. If you look
back to our past career you’ll find that what
I’m telling you is nothing but the honest truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
It’s better to be born lucky than rich any day.”</p>

<p>Jack only laughed at hearing this. He knew
that luck alone is rather a flimsy foundation to
pin confidence on, and that there is something
more needed; but it was not for him to say as
much. If his comrades believed it all a matter
of accident, they were welcome to the delusion.</p>

<p>Somehow they enjoyed the sensation of freedom
more than ever on this day. Perhaps that
came from the unpleasant experience of the
preceding night, when they found themselves
in danger from the angry mob.</p>

<p>It was not long before Josh broke out in song
and amused himself for a spell, entertaining
his chums as well, for he had a pretty good
voice. When they were passing through a
hilly region, with rather abrupt walls on either
shore, it was a peculiar experience that befell
them.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s mocking you, Josh!” cried
Buster indignantly, when they all heard a voice
distinctly repeat the last few words of the song
Josh had finished.</p>

<p>Jack smiled to see the other three look hastily
around, for he guessed the secret immediately.</p>

<p>“Try again, Josh, and see if he keeps it up,”
he went on to say, and when once more the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
same mocking call came back to them Josh began
to grow quite “huffy.”</p>

<p>“Think yourself smart, don’t you?” he
shouted, shaking his fist toward that point
from whence it seemed the taunting voice
hailed.</p>

<p>“Smart, don’t you!” came immediately back
at him.</p>

<p>Then Buster must have seen a great light,
for he gave a loud laugh.</p>

<p>“Say, don’t feel like hitting him, Josh, because
it’s only an <em>echo</em>!” he gurgled.</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it!” snapped George.
“No echo could ever repeat words as plain as
that.”</p>

<p>“Try it yourself and see, George,” advised
Jack, and, realizing that he was in a poor minority,
George did give a shout, only to have it
sent back with an abruptness and energy that
startled him.</p>

<p>The doubter was apparently convinced,
though he kept saying that he never would
have believed it possible for an echo to repeat
such things. As they were speeding along with
the current they quickly passed beyond the
magic range, and hence Buster received no answer
when he shouted lustily at the rocky hillside.</p>

<p>As they had lost so much time that morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
it was decided not to make any stop at noon.
They could manage on some cold lunch, and
wait until night came along to do their cooking.</p>

<p>They frequently saw other boats on the
river. Many of these were clumsy affairs and
evidently owned by farmers, who were in the
habit of getting their produce to market in this
way. Occasionally they passed a small pleasure
boat loaded with people, who, like most excursionists,
waved their hands and handkerchiefs
at the four comely lads aboard the chugging
motorboat.</p>

<p>Seeing Jack, who had temporarily handed
the wheel over to George, examining his little
chart of the river, procured in Vienna, Josh
came and dropped down beside him.</p>

<p>As usual, Josh bristled with interrogation
points. He came of Yankee ancestry and
never could pick up enough information to
satisfy himself. There was always a yearning
to “know” whenever Josh came around, and
he would go straight to the heart of the matter
without any beating about the bush.</p>

<p>“Making pretty good time, eh, Jack?” he
went on to say as a prelude.</p>

<p>“Splendid, Josh, and I’m thinking that
overhauling is going to pay us fairly well in
the end. It certainly has increased the speed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
capacity of the boat by a mile an hour, according
to my reckoning.”</p>

<p>“Bully for that!” ejaculated the other;
“and provided we keep this same pace up for
five or six hours more, whereabouts do you
think we might stop over night?”</p>

<p>Jack must have been doing a little figuring
along those same lines himself, for as Josh
leaned over he put the point of his lead pencil
close to a cross he had made on the chart further
along.</p>

<p>“Providing all goes well, that’s about where
we ought to fetch up on this day’s run,” he
told Josh.</p>

<p>“Looks like we might get to the Serbian
border then by another night, eh, Jack?”</p>

<p>“That’s possible, unless we have another accident,
or get held up some way or other.
While we may figure as much as we please, it’s
never wise to count your chickens, Josh, before
the eggs are hatched. There’s always a
big IF confronting us, because we’re doing this
thing under peculiar conditions, you know.”</p>

<p>“By that I suppose you mean the plagued
old war that had to break out just when we got
well started on our way?” complained Josh.</p>

<p>From one subject he launched into another,
until he had pumped Jack dry&mdash;at least the
other laughingly told him so as he scrambled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
his feet, after replacing his chart in his pocket,
and went over to relieve George.</p>

<p>The long afternoon was wearing away, and
so far everything seemed to be going on all
right. Buster called attention to this fact
every little while, as though it occupied a prominent
place in his mind.</p>

<p>He even allowed himself to remember that
he had promised to try and duplicate his fishing
feat and supply the party with a change in
breakfast food.</p>

<p>“Josh,” he went on to say, “are you game to
run another race this evening with the balance
of our grubs? They’ve kept alive all right,
and ought to be good for a mess of fine fish.”</p>

<p>“I’m your meal ticket,” cheerily announced
the other. “Count me in the game if the
chance opens up; and I hope we have as good
luck as that other time. But say, there’s a
queer looking boat away down the river that I
don’t seem to be able to make head or tail of.
Somebody take a look and tell me what you
think.”</p>

<p>At that there was a general craning of necks.
Then Buster announced his opinion.</p>

<p>“Whatever she is, I think they’re anchored
in the stream, because I can’t see any movement
at all.”</p>

<p>“But that looks like smoke coming from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
stack of some sort,” George observed, as he
cupped both hands in order to shield his eyes
from the bright sunlight, in this way securing
better results.</p>

<p>“Strikes me it’s a cheese box on a raft of
some sort,” Josh gave as a hazard.</p>

<p>“Why, Josh, that was the name the Confederates
gave the Monitor in our civil war, you
know,” burst out Buster; “the single round
turret was built on a low deck just a little above
the water, and I suppose it did look like a
cheese box, such as you can see in the grocery
stores at home.”</p>

<p>“Between you,” said Jack just then,
“you’ve guessed it.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean it’s really and truly a monitor?”
demanded George skeptically.</p>

<p>“I’ve understood that Austria had a number
of these river gunboats down here, and I
think they all mount pretty big guns, as well
as being armored,” Jack went on to say.</p>

<p>“But what use would they be?” queried
George.</p>

<p>“Well, you must know that this eternal
Balkan question is forever bobbing up, and
within a few years there have been two serious
clashes south of Austria. The first was between
Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece against
Turkey. They knocked the Sultan’s forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
out and took a lot of territory away, which
they divided. Then Bulgaria got a notion she
could lick the other two and seize more territory;
but the shoe was on the other foot, because
she had to cry for quarter, and lost a
good portion of land that had come to her from
Turkey. Ever since there has been bad blood
between them all, Rumania also.”</p>

<p>“But how does Austria come in with their
petty quarrels?” continued George.</p>

<p>“Do you remember the old fable of the lion
and the bear fighting over the game they had
taken until they were exhausted, and then the
sly fox walking off with it? Well, Austria got
hold of a monstrous slice of territory in something
the same way&mdash;Bosnia and Herzegovina.
And there’s a big scheme afoot, I believe, for
the Teuton allies to take Serbia and unite the
German-speaking countries with Turkey.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember reading that Germany had
eyes for Persia and all that rich Eastern country,”
admitted Josh.</p>

<p>“Well, they are figuring on great things out
that way,” Jack continued. “As for these
river monitors, they are here to threaten little
Serbia with. You see, it’s unfortunate that
the capital, Belgrade, lies just across from
Austrian heights, and always in reach of hostile
batteries.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“Shucks! that was foolish of the Serbians,”
said Josh disdainfully, after the manner of one
who knew it all. “Long ago they should have
moved their capital to Nisch, nearer the middle
of the state. Then they could defend it a heap
better.”</p>

<p>As they approached closer to the singular
craft anchored there near the shore of the
river the boys eyed it curiously. They could
see many men aboard, doubtless the crew.
There was also an officer using a pair of binoculars,
for they could catch the gleam of the
sunlight on the glasses as he moved his hands.</p>

<p>Without the slightest warning, when they
were almost opposite the anchored monitor,
there came a puff of smoke and a reverberating
boom. The boys saw the water splash high in
the air about twenty feet in front of their little
boat, showing that it had not been blank shot
after all.</p>

<p>Buster was at once in a panic. He really believed
that in another moment they might be
the target for one of those big guns that could
be seen projecting from the movable turret
aboard the monitor, and at that close range the
result must be the total annihilation of boat
and passengers.</p>

<small>NEARING THE SCENE OF WAR</small></h2>


<p>“Pull up, Jack; that’s a plain invitation to
hold our horses!” shrilled Josh, being the first
one to find his voice.</p>

<p>Jack already knew this. He shut off power
and then started to reverse, for the impetus of
the craft, not to mention the swift current, was
carrying the boat forward at a good pace, and
any sign of disobeying that naval summons
might cost them dear.</p>

<p>“There, he’s beckoning to us to run over
alongside,” said Josh. “Mebbe we’ll be given
a chance now to see what one of these same
river monitors look like.”</p>

<p>“Huh! like as not we’ll be given a chance to
see what a musty old dungeon under some Austrian
fortress looks like!”</p>

<p>Of course, it was George who made this last
gloomy prediction; but then the others were so
accustomed to his ways that no one paid the
least attention to him.</p>

<p>Jack was already heading the boat toward
the anchored vessel. All of them had a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
good chance to observe what a monitor looked
like as they approached, and if they failed to
accept their opportunity, that was their fault.</p>

<p>Coming up from below, they bumped against
the armored side of the bulky war vessel. Buster
looked with something of awe at the gaping
guns of large caliber that projected from the
turret close by.</p>

<p>When Josh, coached by Jack, had tossed a
rope to some of the waiting crew of the monitor,
they prepared to go aboard. Jack might
have limited the number to himself and perhaps
Josh, but then he knew the others would
always be sorry they had not been given the
privilege of saying they had once been aboard
a fighting warship while war was on; so he allowed
both George and Buster to trip after.</p>

<p>It could be seen that the officer was plainly
surprised when he saw them at close quarters.
Instead of the local boys whom he might have
expected to meet, he now realized that the tiny
flag floating from the stern of the motorboat
stood for something.</p>

<p>“Who are you, and where do you come
from?” he asked in excellent English, doubtless
realizing that it was useless to ply them
with Magyar.</p>

<p>“We are American boys, sir, as you can see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
from our flag,” Jack told him. “It is the only
one we happen to have along with us.”</p>

<p>He thought that the captain looked very
much interested, and that his manner became
immediately a shade more cordial, which
proved that he knew considerable about the
country across the ocean.</p>

<p>“But this is a strange place for four American
boys to be taking a cruise, you must admit,”
he told Jack.</p>

<p>That gave the boy a chance to begin explanations.
He went over the same ground as before
and told how as members of a motorboat club
they had planned to voyage down the Danube,
and only learned of war breaking out when
on the way.</p>

<p>When he mentioned the matter of passports
the officer indicated that he should like to see
them, at which once more Jack called upon his
chums to produce their papers.</p>

<p>“You will find them all correct, sir,” he assured
the other; “and besides, here are some
letters from home which we received from our
folks. They reached us in Budapest, you can
see. I would like you to glance over them so
that you may know we are just what we claim
to be.”</p>

<p>The officer seemed to be pretty well satisfied
after he had examined the passports. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
same time he looked at the boys in an amused
fashion.</p>

<p>“Which one of you is George Rollins?” he
asked, somewhat to the astonishment of that
worthy, who did not know what might be in
store for him, honors or captivity.</p>

<p>“That’s my name, sir,” he spoke up, and, to
the further surprise of the boys, the Austrian
commander thrust out his hand.</p>

<p>“I want to shake hands with you, George,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Y-yes, sir,” replied the other, still groping
in the dark, and fearing that he might be perilously
near the edge of a precipice.</p>

<p>“You wonder why I single you out from
your companions,” continued the other, as
George accepted his hand and received a cordial
squeeze in return. “I’ll have to explain, I
suppose. Did you ever hear your mother
speak of a cousin who had married an Austrian
gentleman many years ago?”</p>

<p>Then George found his tongue.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I certainly have heard her speak
of her cousin Lucy, and the name of the gentleman
she married was&mdash;let me see, Stanislaus!”</p>

<p>As George burst out triumphantly with this
declaration he found his hand once more
shaken and squeezed, while the commander of
the monitor beamed upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I am Captain Stanislaus, and my
mother was that same Cousin Lucy you have
heard about. So you see, my boy, we are kin.
I am very glad to meet you, even under such
singular conditions.”</p>

<p>George turned toward his companions. His
face was one broad smile. He doubtless had a
pretty good sense of his own importance just
then.</p>

<p>“I want to introduce my three chums to you,
Cousin Stanislaus,” he went on to say with an
air of importance. “The one you have been
talking with is Jack Stormways, our leader;
the stout one is Buster Longfellow, and the
other is Josh Purdue, all of them the finest fellows
under the sun, and my pards.”</p>

<p>The officer gravely shook hands with each of
the boys in turn. He seemed to be duly impressed
with the recommendation given by his
newly discovered relative.</p>

<p>“See, here is a letter from my mother, sir,”
continued George impulsively and with a deep
motive back of his actions. “Her name is
Alice, and she is first cousin to your mother.
How pleased she will be to learn that I ran
across you in this remarkable way! And because
we are related, as it seems, I hope you
will allow us to continue our voyage down the
river, for it would be a great disappointment
all around if we had to give it up now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack felt like clapping George on the back
when he heard that naive appeal. Evidently
George believed in making use of his relatives.
What was the use of blood ties if favors could
not be obtained through them?</p>

<p>All of them waited anxiously to see what the
commander of the monitor might say. Ties of
relationship might be all very well, but there
was such a thing as duty to the Government to
be considered. Of course, he knew very well
that nothing was to be feared from these American
boys, who would not have any reason for
carrying news to the hostile Serbians. Hence
it was really only a matter of their taking unnecessary
risks in trying to pass the disputed
portions of the Danube where opposing batteries
might be bombarding each other.</p>

<p>The officer looked from one to another. He
saw only appealing glances that undoubtedly
must have made him weaken in his first resolve
to order the boys back and end their adventurous
voyage then and there.</p>

<p>“We are accustomed to looking out for ourselves,
believe me, sir,” Jack thought fit to say
just then, hoping to be able to influence the
commander, who seemed to be what Josh would
call “on the fence.”</p>

<p>“All we expect to do,” George went on to
say, “is to slip past some night when it happens
to be cloudy, and, once by the Iron Gate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the way is clear for us on to the mouth of the
Danube. We have spent a heap of money to
have this trip, and it would break us all up if
we had to quit.”</p>

<p>The officer laughed at that.</p>

<p>“Well,” he went on to say, “I suppose, after
all, it is none of my business, and I could allow
you to proceed without any risk that you would
carry important news of troop movements to
the enemy beyond the Danube. It is with regard
to your mother, George, I am thinking
most of all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you fear about her, sir!” cried
the boy enthusiastically. “She knows I’ve always
been able to paddle my own canoe and
find some way to get out of every sort of scrape.
Please say that you will wash your hands of
us and let us go about our business.”</p>

<p>“Very well, let it be just as you will have it,
George. I do wash my hands of the whole business.
You see, I have been young myself not
very long back, and know what it means to a
fellow to be terribly disappointed. Only promise
me on your word of honor that you will not
run any unnecessary risks in trying to pass
Belgrade in the night time.”</p>

<p>Of course, George was only too glad to do
this, and so they were allowed to go aboard the
motorboat again, parting from the Austrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
commander with mutual wishes for good luck.</p>

<p>George was about the happiest fellow going
during the next hour. He seemed to be beaming
with good nature.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of such a remarkable
thing happening in all your life?” he demanded
of Buster, whom he had cornered.
“To think that, with the whole of this big country
of Austria-Hungary to choose from, we
should have picked out the Danube River for
our cruise, and that just at the same time my
second cousin with his warship should be stationed
down here! Then again, remember how
he fired a shot across our bows to bring us to,
and, seeing my name on my passport, realized
that we were actually blood relations!”</p>

<p>“It was queer, for a fact,” agreed Buster.</p>

<p>“Queer, you call it, do you, Buster?” cried
George. “Why, I think it the most astonishing
coincidence that ever happened. I’m sure
none of us have even run across its equal. And
then, what’s more, he let us proceed just because
I was his cousin twice removed. Don’t
forget that, Buster, will you, some time when
you and Josh feel like giving me a dig or two?
Oh, I’m of a little consequence once in a long
time.”</p>

<p>“You’re of a whole lot of consequence plenty
of times, George,” said Josh just then, “and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
we all acknowledge the corn; but for goodness’
sake please give us a change of tune now.
We’ve been hearing about Cousin Stanislaus
until even the swallows swinging past seem to
be chirping the name; and I expect the fish will
give it to us, too, if we catch any to-night.”</p>

<p>George looked a little hurt in his feelings at
this thrust, but he subsided all the same, going
off by himself where he could ponder upon the
freaks of fortune that had thrown him in contact
with this relative at the other side of the
world, so to speak. From time to time he
would smile as though his thoughts were pleasant
ones; but none of the others interrupted
his meditations.</p>

<p>The day drew near a close, and as they had
really come up to Jack’s expectations it might
be set down as possible that they would camp
somewhere close by the place marked with a
cross on the chart.</p>

<p>That would mean only one more day’s journey
before they must find themselves in the
vicinity of battle scenes, if, as they suspected,
the Austrians had started to bombard Belgrade
and were being answered shot for shot
from their fortifications by the valiant Serbian
gunners.</p>

<p>They were fortunate enough to find a particularly
good camp site. It was in the midst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of some trees that offered them all the comforts
they could wish for. At the same time they
had no reason to believe they were anywhere
near a town, and the river in this spot looked
quite lonely and deserted; at least there was no
other war monitor in sight, from the deck of
which their movements might be observed and
deemed suspicious enough to warrant a visit of
investigation.</p>

<p>As evening drew on they tied the boat securely
and built a fire close by. Buster, as
usual, insisted on taking charge of the cooking,
while the rest lay around or gathered fuel for
the fire.</p>

<p>It was while moving about with this latter
purpose in view that Jack suddenly came upon
a crouching figure in the brush. At his exclamation
the unknown party struggled to his
feet. Jack had been alarmed at first, not knowing
but what there might be bandits in that
vicinity. He quickly saw, however, that he
had a peaked looking and very hungry fairly
well grown boy to deal with.</p>

<p>Not wishing to let the other see that he had
been startled, Jack immediately demanded to
know who he was and why he was spying on
them. The other made motions to let Jack understand
he could not speak English. He then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
went on to say something in rapid tones, but it
was all Greek to Jack.</p>

<p>However, from his appearance and the motions
he made to his mouth, as well as showing
how empty his stomach was, it was easy to
judge that it was the smell of the cooking supper
that had drawn him.</p>

<p>“Stay with us, then, and share our meal,”
suggested Jack, mostly in pantomime; and evidently
his gestures must have had a convincing
way of their own, for the hungry boy immediately
nodded his head, said something in
a fervent tone, and, to Jack’s embarrassment,
proceeded to kiss his hand violently.</p>

<p>“Hey, what’s all this going on here?” asked
Josh, just then coming on the scene, no doubt
attracted by the sound of a strange voice.</p>

<p>“Here’s a poor tramp of a boy who gives me
to understand he’s half dead with hunger,”
Jack went on to explain; “and as we can’t turn
him away in that condition, we’ll have to let
him stay to supper with us, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Josh, of course, was exceedingly surprised.
He looked the strange boy over and saw that
he undoubtedly had a hungry appearance.</p>

<p>“Sure we’ll share our supper with him,
Jack,” he hastened to say, being one of those
fellows who could never see any one suffer
when he had a chance to offer assistance; “who
knows but what we may be entertaining an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
angel unawares, like we read about. Tell him
to come along up to the fire right away.”</p>

<p>Buster and George were also somewhat astonished
at this increase to their number.
Still the poor chap looked so woebegone that
Buster immediately saw to it that an extra portion
of food was prepared. George, too, did
not have the heart to show his objecting nature.
He thought this to be a real case of necessity.</p>

<p>The strange boy was fairly well grown,
though slender. His face was dark and he had
a mass of heavy black hair. His eyes were
dazzlingly bright, and, although there was an
uneasy look on his face, he could smile cheerily
when he saw that any of them were looking at
him.</p>

<p>Josh watched him from time to time, as
though some notion had come into that shrewd
head of his. Supper was getting along nicely
when Jack saw Josh beckoning to him cautiously
at a time the stranger happened to be
looking another way.</p>

<p>Then Josh strolled off a short distance and
seemed to be bending down, as if looking at
something that interested him.</p>

<p>“What’s in the wind?” asked Jack softly,
as he joined the other.</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly, to tell you the truth,
but I’m uneasy over something, and wanted to
have a little chin with you,” came the reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re suspicious, that’s what, Josh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I admit as much,” replied the
other. “You see, in these times we’ve got to be
careful. Instead of an angel we may be entertaining
one of the other kind.”</p>

<p>“Now get it out of your system, and tell me
what you’re thinking about,” demanded Jack.</p>

<p>“First of all, he turns his head and looks
every little while in a certain direction. I’ve
got a good notion the boy must have friends
hidden somewhere near by.”</p>

<p>“Yes, go on, Josh; what else?”</p>

<p>“Then, if you come to think of it, he doesn’t
talk the same lingo as these Hungarian Magyars
we’ve met. I’m not dead sure about it,
but I’ve got a hunch he must be of another
nationality. Well, what nation are we closest
to below here? What but Serbia? Are you
following me, Jack?”</p>

<p>“I am, so keep going,” the other informed
him.</p>

<p>“You remember the story we were told by
that polite Hungarian officer, about the four
desperate Serbian youths who had sworn to
have the life of the aged Austrian emperor&mdash;well,
according to my notion, our guest is one
of the batch; and his three tough cronies are
hidden close by, waiting for some signal!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>THE BOY FROM SERBIA</small></h2>


<p>Jack remained silent for a full minute after
his companion had delivered himself of this
startling statement. He was evidently thinking
it over. Perhaps up to then Jack had not
even suspected the tramp of being anything
more than he seemed, a well-grown lad who
was far away from home&mdash;and hungry.</p>

<p>Presently Jack spoke again, and from his
manner it became apparent that he now shared
in some degree the alarm that Josh seemed to
be laboring under. Really, the conditions were
suspicious enough to demand an investigation.
They were next to unarmed, and if four desperate
young fellows raided their camp they
would find it difficult indeed to keep from losing
everything they possessed, from boat to
supplies.</p>

<p>“I hate to think that such a thing can be
possible, Josh,” he said slowly, “but, as you
were remarking, the circumstances force us to
be on our guard. Before we start to eating
supper, which must be nearly ready now, I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
try and strike up a conversation with the fellow
and learn something about him.”</p>

<p>“But how on earth can you do that, Jack,
when neither of you seem able to understand
one word of each other’s tongue?”</p>

<p>“Oh, leave that to me, Josh. There are
ways, you know, even if I have to come to
paper and pencil and use the picture writing
of the Indians. What with signs and nods and
looks we may get a fair understanding.”</p>

<p>“No harm trying, that’s a fact,” admitted
Josh. “But I’ll watch my chance and put the
others wise. Every one of us ought to have
some sort of club handy so as to protect the
camp and the boat if there’s going to be a
raid.”</p>

<p>Apparently the more Josh considered the
subject the stronger became his belief that he
had hit the truth in making that guess. In his
eyes the dark face of the young stranger now
began to assume a threatening appearance,
whereas before it had only seemed hungry and
eager and almost sad.</p>

<p>Jack watched his opportunity and soon
found a chance to drop down beside the stranger.
He saw that there was intelligence in the
face of the other. It could also be seen in his
flashing eyes. If Jack had only been able to
understand and speak the other’s language he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
felt sure he could induce him to tell his story.</p>

<p>He took out a pencil and a pad of paper and
began to draw. As Jack was a master hand at
this sort of thing, he quickly produced a sketch
that represented four boys, all dressed alike,
and in the costume which the young stranger
wore.</p>

<p>This he held before the other, and then
pointed to him as he nodded. After looking at
the drawing intently the boy shook his head. It
was evidently intended for a denial that he had
three companions, but then Jack could hardly
have expected him to admit it openly.</p>

<p>One thing sure, he did not seem to be
alarmed, as though suspecting that his secret
had been discovered; only puzzled.</p>

<p>As if governed by a sudden impulse, he motioned
for the pencil and paper, just as Jack
expected he would do, and in his turn began to
draw something. When he handed the pad
back it was seen that he had actually made a
pretty accurate map of the enlarged Serbia of
to-day; doubtless every schoolboy in that country
was early taught to be able to do this, on
account of the great pride the Serbian people
took in their recent victories over Turkey and
Bulgaria.</p>

<p>He had even written in bold letters the magical
word “Serbia” across this map, as if determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
to remove all doubt as to what it was
meant for. Such frankness made Jack begin
to believe that the other could not possibly be
the desperate character Josh suspected; had
he been, it would only have seemed natural
for him to deny his nationality lest he be arrested
and put in an Austrian dungeon.</p>

<p>Jack went a step further, after the boy, first
pointing to his map, smote his own chest
proudly and smiled, as if to proclaim that he
belonged in that country. By various gestures
he tried to ask the other what he was doing
here in a hostile land.</p>

<p>The other watched his every gesture and
seemed to be reading even the expression on
Jack’s face. It is surprising how much can be
learned that way. Whole conversations may
be carried on by instinct and intelligence. One
who does not know a single word of Italian
may be able to sense the general meaning of
many paragraphs in a newspaper war item by
the similarity of words. Try it, and you will
see that this is really so.</p>

<p>By slow and laborious degrees Jack began to
pick up something of what the other was trying
to tell him. The further he proceeded the more
intense did the boy seem to become. Buster,
glancing that way from time to time, filled
with curiosity, considered that they were using<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
their hands almost as cleverly as a couple of
mutes did whom he had once watched talking
in the sign language.</p>

<p>Of course, Josh had before then managed to
whisper to each of the other two what a
“mare’s nest” he believed he had unearthed,
so that both George and Buster had begun to
look on the intruder in the light of a dangerous
fellow. George kept caressing a stout cudgel
of which he had become possessed, as though
determined not to be caught entirely defenseless
in case of a sudden raid.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose Jack’s really finding out
anything?” Buster whispered to Josh when
the other leaned down as if to ascertain how the
supper was coming on.</p>

<p>“Sure he is,” replied the other, “though
chances are the cub’s giving him taffy just to
keep him quiet.”</p>

<p>“But Jack seems to be interested a whole
lot,” objected Buster.</p>

<p>“I think Jack means to join us presently,
from the way he nodded to me just then,” Josh
went on to say hastily, “so don’t hurry on the
supper more than you can help. For all we
know we may have to share it with <em>four</em> instead
of one.”</p>

<p>It proved to be just as Josh had predicted,
for presently Jack left the side of the dark-faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
young stranger and come over to the fire.</p>

<p>“Well, how did you manage to get on with
him?” asked Josh impetuously.</p>

<p>“It grew easier as we went on,” said Jack.
“He knows just a little bit of English, after all.
When that failed he resorted to the paper and
pencil, or else made gestures. When I shook
my head to tell him it was all a mystery to me,
he would try again in a different way, and we
always succeeded in getting there by one means
or another.”</p>

<p>“Did he own up in the end, Jack?” asked
Josh.</p>

<p>“If you mean about being one of the four
Serbian youths we thought he might be, he denied
it absolutely,” came the reply.</p>

<p>“H’m! What else could you expect, since
their game had been knocked on the head by
the breaking out of the war and they found
themselves being hunted like rats in a hostile
territory, afraid to ask for anything to eat because
they’d like as not be grabbed? No wonder
he looks hungry, say I.”</p>

<p>Jack looked at the other and shook his head.</p>

<p>“This time you’re away off, old fellow,” he
told Josh. “He didn’t come up into Austria-Hungary
on an errand of blood, but one of
mercy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“As how, Jack?” asked Buster, already
deeply interested.</p>

<p>“He has a little sister,” the other went on to
say. “She seems to be just so high,” and he
held his hand about three feet from the ground,
“from which I’d judge she might be something
like six or seven years old.”</p>

<p>“A sister, eh?” George remarked skeptically.</p>

<p>“Listen, fellows,” continued Jack, “here’s
the story he told me as near as I was able to
make it out, for lots of times I had to just guess
at things; but it ran fairly smooth, after all.
He lived in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia.
There was his mother, a widow with some
means, and one little sister. This girl, it
seems, was blind and the pet of everybody who
knew her.”</p>

<p>“Gee! that sounds interesting,” muttered
Josh.</p>

<p>“Some time ago the mother learned of a celebrated
surgeon up in Budapest who had performed
wonderful cures with people afflicted
just as the little child was. It was determined
to take the girl to him, and an appointment
was made; but just then the mother had the
misfortune to sprain her ankle and could not
walk a step.”</p>

<p>“Tough luck,” said Buster, “and I can see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
what the boy did. He looks like he had the grit
to carry anything like that out, sure he does.”</p>

<p>Apparently Buster was taking stock in
Jack’s story and changing his opinion again
with regard to the dark-faced young stranger.</p>

<p>“Yes, there was nothing for it but that the
boy go to Budapest with his little sister and
stay there while the operation went on. From
what he tells me he was in the Hungarian capital
nearly a month. The surgeon operated,
and the thing turned out a splendid success.
You ought to have seen how his face lighted up
when he told me in sign language that she
could see now just as well as any one.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t he start home right away,
knowing how anxious his mother must be?”
asked George incredulously.</p>

<p>“First the surgeon would not allow it for a
certain time after the bandages were taken off.
Then, as luck would have it, just when they
were about to start, a thief broke into their
apartment and stole every dollar, or whatever
money the Serbians use.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how tough that was!” exclaimed Buster
sympathetically.</p>

<p>“A likely story, I call it,” muttered George.</p>

<p>“On top of it all the war broke out, and he
knew that unless they hurried off from Budapest
the Hungarian authorities might arrest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
them. So they sold a few of their things and
get enough money together to carry them part
of the way to the Serbian border. Then they
had to leave the train and start to tramp the
rest of the way. Neither of them have had a
bite this whole day. Seeing us land, he became
desperate and determined to appeal to us to
help him, if we looked as if we were kind people.
Then I chanced to run across him. That’s
what he told me, as near as I could make it
out.”</p>

<p>Jack saw that while Buster and Josh were
disposed to believe the young stranger, George
still hung back.</p>

<p>“It makes a pretty interesting story, that’s
right,” was what George said, “but there’s a
fishy part to it. That little sister sounds like
an invention to get our sympathy. Where is
she at, I’d like to know; let him produce the
kid, say I.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>FRIENDS IN TIME OF NEED</small></h2>


<p>“That’s so, Jack; unless he can produce the
little sister we’ve got to believe his fine yarn is
all a fraud,” Josh observed seriously.</p>

<p>“Did you say as much to him, Jack?” questioned
George.</p>

<p>“I did,” came the ready reply.</p>

<p>“And what was his reply to that?” asked
Buster.</p>

<p>“I gathered from his gestures and actions,”
explained Jack, “that he stood ready, yes, and
anxious, to go into the woods near by and get
his sister, if only we gave him permission. So
I thought I’d put it up to the rest of you first.”</p>

<p>“Oh, tell him to go and fetch her along,”
sneered George. “If he really has got a little
sister, and she’s hungry, why, I’d be willing to
go on half rations myself to help out. I may
be suspicious of him, but there isn’t a stingy
bone in my whole body.”</p>

<p>“We know that, George,” Jack told him
quickly, “and since you seem willing I’ll let
the poor fellow know about it right away. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
can see how eagerly he’s watching us now, because
he understands what I’m telling you.”</p>

<p>“Tell him supper’s about ready, and that he
ought to hurry,” explained Buster.</p>

<p>Jack had another short interview with the
young Serbian. Then the other sprang hastily
to his feet and ran off, looking back once or
twice, and smiling as he waved his hand toward
Jack.</p>

<p>“Good-by!” called out George derisively,
and then, turning to the others, he added:
“Because I hardly expect to see him again, unless
he comes back with the other three.
Chances are he knew we’d got on to his game,
and means to slip away now so he couldn’t be
nabbed by the authorities.”</p>

<p>“Shame on you, George, you old unbeliever!”
cried Buster.</p>

<p>“Wait and see who’s right,” warned the
other sturdily, for George always clung to his
belief until convinced that he was wrong, when
he would frankly confess his error of judgment.</p>

<p>A minute, two of them, passed, and still the
boy did not return. It would really seem as
though he had had time to go to where he left
his sister concealed at the time he crept toward
the landing spot of the cruising party in the
motorboat, and come back again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>George was grinning with that important air
of his, which, being interpreted, meant the
usual “I told you so.”</p>

<p>Then Josh, whose sharp eyes had detected a
moving figure in the semi-gloom, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“There they come over yonder, I do believe!”</p>

<p>“Two or four?” questioned Buster.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, boys,” Josh continued, for he
was standing on a stump, and in this position
could see what was invisible to the others.</p>

<p>“Then he’s got his little sister along with
him, has he?” asked Buster.</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” reported Josh, “and as for
you, old croaker George, it’d be doing the right
thing for you to beg everybody’s pardon, and
especially the boy’s, for thinking such mean
things about him.”</p>

<p>“Who was the first to guess that he must be
one of that band of desperate Serbian youths,
tell me?” demanded George. “I was wrong,
I’ll admit, but an ounce of prevention is always
better than a whole pound of cure.”</p>

<p>With that he threw away the club which he
had been gripping, as though in company with
it went all his suspicions.</p>

<p>Presently the Serbian boy came into camp,
holding by the hand a pretty dark-eyed little
maid of about seven. The boys were immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
smitten with her charms, and no longer
wondered that her brother had so openly
boasted she was the prettiest little girl in all
Belgrade.</p>

<p>Apparently that noted surgeon had done a
splendid job, for never had they looked into
brighter and more roguish eyes than she possessed.
If they had been dulled by cataracts,
as Jack suspected was the case, then the curtains
had been skillfully removed.</p>

<p>Buster immediately announced that supper
was all ready, and would be spoiled by any
further waiting; so they sat down, places being
prepared for the guests of honor.</p>

<p>While they ate the boys kept up a conversation
among themselves. Jack from time to
time would hold communication with the Serbian
youth, whose appetite proved the truth of
his assertion that no food had passed his lips
during the whole of the preceding day.</p>

<p>Later on Buster amused himself trying to
talk with the little girl and teach her a few
words in English. Jack and Josh and George
got their heads together, being desirous of settling
on what they ought to do with regard to
the pair cast adrift in a strange and hostile
land.</p>

<p>“They can stay with us all night, anyway,
and have breakfast in the morning,” suggested
Josh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“And we could make up a little purse among
us,” added the now penitent George, “enough
to carry them across the border and into their
own country.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine of you to mention that,
George,” Jack told him, “but you are forgetting
something. Serbia is at war with Austria,
and so you see no trains can be running to
the border that would allow a Serbian young
fellow to pass. If he ever gets across the river
to Belgrade it must be with our help.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got a plan fixed, I guess, Jack?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking it over, and wanted to
hear what your ideas might be before I mentioned
it,” the other explained. “But, now
that you ask me, I’ll tell you what I’d like to
do. We can find room for them aboard the
boat when we start in the morning. Unless we
are overhauled on the way there’d be little
danger on account of our having Serbians with
us, a boy and a child at that.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you there, Jack,” said George,
now evidently seeking to make all amends possible
for having allowed himself to believe the
stranger a desperate character, when in truth
he was only a kind and protecting big brother.</p>

<p>“Ditto here,” added Josh glibly, as though
he were a parrot.</p>

<p>“We will have to tie up by the time another
night comes along,” continued Jack, “and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
it’s cloudy we can hope to try and pass the
hostile batteries by keeping in the middle of
the river and just floating with the current,
never showing a single light. But before that
we might make a landing on the Serbian side
and put the brother and sister ashore.”</p>

<p>Josh and George exchanged looks, nodding
their heads as if in approval.</p>

<p>“Now, I call that a good scheme, if you want
to know it,” declared the former.</p>

<p>“And as Buster is always ready to agree to
anything Jack says,” George remarked, “I
move we call it unanimous.”</p>

<p>The readiness of his chums to fall in with
his proposition, of course, pleased Jack. He
always made it a point to invite the fullest discussion
when offering any plan of campaign,
because it was better that all of them should
feel that they had a hand in engineering matters.</p>

<p>So it was settled, later on Buster being told
the arrangements. As George had prophesied,
the fat boy had not the slightest objection to
make; indeed, he was enthusiastic over the idea
of helping the little Serbian girl get back home
to her anxious mother.</p>

<p>Arrangements for sleeping were soon effected.
As their guests had no blankets,
George and Buster insisted on loaning them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
one each. They said they could go without
easily enough; though Jack finally induced
George to share his covers, while Josh compelled
the fat chum to crawl under with him.</p>

<p>The night passed without anything occurring
to disturb them. Everybody slept after a
fashion, though doubtless the boys were not as
comfortable as though each possessed his own
blanket.</p>

<p>It made them feel that they were suffering
in a good cause, however, when they saw how
happy both the boy and his sister seemed in the
morning. The dark clouds that had of late
been hanging over their heads had apparently
taken flight, and with the rising sun they
smiled, and seemed contented with having
found such good friends.</p>

<p>After breakfast they started down the river
again. It might prove to be the last day of
peace for them for some time, since Jack figured
that by another sunset they would very
likely have reached the scene of hostilities,
when danger might be lying in wait for them
at every turn.</p>

<p>Of course, all of them were more or less concerned
about the prospect of being held up
again by some Austrian river war vessel. The
presence of Serbians aboard the motorboat
would look suspicious in those trying days, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
might get the boys into trouble. Nevertheless,
not one of them so much as hinted at any desire
to be rid of their guests.</p>

<p>The little girl was so winsome that she had
captured all their hearts by storm, and they
could not do too much for her.</p>

<p>As the afternoon began to pass Jack looked
earnestly ahead many times. He wondered
what awaited them in that mysterious region
whence they were headed. All sorts of strange
things might crop up to confront them as they
proceeded on their dangerous course; still, no
one even gave the idea of turning back a
thought.</p>

<p>He had managed to let the Serbian boy know
what they meant to do about getting his sister
and himself on his native soil. How those black
eyes snapped as the plan was unfolded to him!
Jack fancied he could see unshed tears there
also, showing how their generosity must have
affected the other. He could not express his
gratitude by repeating that one word “thank”
again, but he did display it by almost fiercely
seizing Jack’s hand and actually kissing it, an
act that made the American boy feel exceedingly
queer, because he was not accustomed to
such things.</p>

<p>They kept, as a rule, closer to the right bank
of the river, for that would in time prove to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the one on which the Serbian capital was located.
Besides, Jack believed it would answer
their purposes better in case circumstances
forced them to make a hurried landing, so that
their passengers might conceal themselves in
the brush.</p>

<p>The sun was hot again, and as the afternoon
began to wear along they found that the breeze
created by their own swift passage was the only
invigorating thing to be met with.</p>

<p>“But it’s beginning to cloud up, you can
see,” Josh remarked, when Buster complained
that he was melting away with the heat; “and
once the old sun gets out of sight it’ll be a whole
lot more comfy.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been watching those clouds,” remarked
Jack, “and they please me a whole lot,
because we must have a cloudy night if we’re
ever going to run past the batteries on both
sides of the river.”</p>

<p>“Whew! that sounds as if we might be away
back in the civil war, trying to pass Memphis
on a gunboat, with the Confeds whanging away
at us to beat the band. But, of course, you
don’t expect to have any real trouble getting
by, do you, Jack?”</p>

<p>“So far as I can see, there’s no reason why
we should meet up with any,” the skipper informed
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“And once we’re well by Belgrade the worst
will be over,” cheerily observed Josh. “You
see, the railroad runs down through Serbia
from the capital, and any invasion must, of
course, follow the Morava River, because
Serbia is a mountainous country, and there are
passes through which troops have to go if ever
they hope to reach Nisch down near the middle
of the nation.”</p>

<p>“Seems like you’ve been reading up on
Serbia, Josh,” ventured George.</p>

<p>“I have, all about the last war between the
Balkan States,” Josh admitted. “And let me
tell you right here, if the Austrians and the
Germans ever try to invade that little country
of born fighters they’ll find they’ve bitten off
more than they can chew. The Serbians know
every foot of ground, and can lay in ambush
on the heights, dropping rocks down on the
enemy, and using all sorts of quick-firing guns
to cut them down in windrows.”</p>

<p>“If only all these Balkan countries were
agreed on a single policy,” said Jack, “they
could snap their fingers at the Teuton alliance,
for no force could ever be brought to bear
against them that would smash their defenses.
But petty jealousies keep them apart, and may
be their undoing in the end.”</p>

<p>The sun vanished about this time, the clouds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
having risen far enough to cover his blazing
face.</p>

<p>“That feels a heap better,” announced the
panting Buster; “and it looks like we mightn’t
glimpse old Sol again to-day. For one I’m
glad. Sunshine is all very well in winter time,
but when it’s hot summer I prefer the shade.”</p>

<p>The others laughed at his odd way of putting
it, for Buster often expressed himself in a
peculiar fashion. Josh said he “mixed his
metaphors,” though Buster was never able to
get him to explain what he meant by saying
that.</p>

<p>Just then something came stealing to their
ears that caused the boys to exchange meaning
glances. It was a distant grumbling that died
away almost as soon as it reached them, a sort
of complaining, reverberating boom that
brought a thrill with it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>THE BOOMING OF BIG GUNS</small></h2>


<p>“Another storm coming, worse luck!” grumbled
George.</p>

<p>“Going to spoil all our fine plans in the bargain,”
added Josh; “for if it turns out to be
anything as bad as that other whooper, excuse
me from wanting to be out on the river in the
middle of the night.”</p>

<p>“Listen again!” said Jack, with a meaning
in his manner.</p>

<p>“There she goes, and I must say it’s kind of
queer thunder, after all,” Buster advanced;
“each growl is separate and distinct, and not
like anything I ever heard before.”</p>

<p>“Sure enough,” continued Josh; and then,
as though a sudden light had dawned upon
him, he turned to Jack to add: “Say, you
don’t imagine now, do you, that can be the
booming of big guns we are listening to?”</p>

<p>Jack nodded his head in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“It must be,” he said positively.</p>

<p>“Sounds just like blasts,” continued Josh,
“up in the quarry near our town, when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
let the same off by electricity at noon, when the
men are all out of the workings. Boom! boom!
boom! boom! Let me tell you they must be
making things hum over there now, with all
that firing going on.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose they’re doing,
Jack?” asked George.</p>

<p>“For one thing sending shells into Belgrade,”
came the reply.</p>

<p>“Look, the Serbian boy has caught on as well
as the rest of us,” said Josh, “and it frets him
a whole lot, too, you can see by his face. Now
he’s talking with the little sister, and pointing,
as if he might be explaining what that sound
means.”</p>

<p>“Well, can you blame him for feeling that
way?” burst out Buster; “when you must remember
that their mother is somewhere in
Belgrade, and with those shells bursting in the
city they may get home only to find that they
have been left orphans. I guess war is all that
General Sherman said it was.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks! We haven’t seen hardly anything
of its horrors yet. Wait till you read
what is happening in Belgium about this time,
and then it’ll be time to talk,” George told
him.</p>

<p>“But why didn’t we hear the cannonading
before?” asked Buster; “it seemed to hit us all
of a sudden.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because there was a shift of the wind,” explained
Jack. “You know it was on our right
before, and since then has changed, so that now
it seems to be coming straight from the south.”</p>

<p>As they kept on down the river the sounds,
reaching their ears every once in so often, increased
gradually in volume.</p>

<p>Every time the suggestive sound came to
their ears it could be seen that the two young
Serbians would start and listen eagerly. Undoubtedly
their thoughts must be centered on
the home they had left in Belgrade, and they
were wondering if the latest shell could have
dropped anywhere near that dearly loved spot.</p>

<p>“Honest, now,” said Josh presently, “after
that last shot I could hear a second fainter
crash, which I take it may have been the shell
exploding in or over the city.”</p>

<p>“It may have been a Serbian gun, after all,”
George asserted, “and if so, then the shoe was
on the other foot, and the shell burst in the
fortifications on the Austrian side of the Danube,
perhaps scattering guns and soldiers
around as if they were so many logs.”</p>

<p>“That’s what our friend here is hoping deep
down in his heart, you can be sure,” Jack mentioned,
with a glance toward the boy passenger.</p>

<p>“Look away down yonder and tell me if that
isn’t one of those monitors like my cousin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Captain Stanislaus commands,” said George
just then.</p>

<p>Josh tested his eagle eye and admitted that,
while the surface of the river was misty, which
fact made seeing difficult, he believed the other
was right, and that the object they were looking
at did resemble a “cheese-box on a raft” in
marine architecture.</p>

<p>“Then we can’t be so very far above Belgrade,”
Jack concluded.</p>

<p>“You mean the monitor may have been doing
some of that shelling, do you?” questioned
Buster.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that, for none of us
have seen any sign of firing aboard the boat;
but she’s evidently anchored there to take part
in protecting the Austrian troops that will soon
be attempting to cross to hostile territory. So
we must expect to haul in somewhere along here
and wait for night to settle down.”</p>

<p>“It would be too risky to try and pass the
monitor, I reckon you mean?” George asked.</p>

<p>“You remember how we were brought up
with a round turn the other time,” he was reminded;
“and if we refused to obey the summons
to come alongside a second shot would
sink us like a stone.”</p>

<p>“Whee! if one of those big shells ever struck
this chip of a boat there wouldn’t be enough of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
her left for firewood,” asserted Josh. “So I
say just as you do, Jack; we mustn’t be too
brash and take chances. We can’t expect to
fight the whole Austrian navy on the Danube.
The word for us is diplomacy, remember that.
We’ve got to play the Napoleon style of strategy
if we hope to win out in this game.”</p>

<p>Jack allowed the boat to continue on her
course for some little time longer. He did not
mean to take unnecessary chances, but at the
same time the further they were down the
river before night set in the better, since it
would shorten the time they expected to be in
the danger zone.</p>

<p>He kept a wary eye on the anchored monitor,
for all of them could by this time plainly see
that it was one of those strange looking vessels,
believed by Austria to be just suited to the
waters of the Danube for offense and defense.</p>

<p>When not employed in this fashion Jack
was watching the near-by shore for a favorable
landing spot. They could proceed to make a
fire and act as though fully intending to spend
the night there. If by accident they had visitors
from the monitor early in the evening
they could arrange it so that nothing suspicious
would be seen.</p>

<p>The firing had now ceased for the time being,
as though enough had been accomplished on
either side for the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not long before they found themselves
up against the bank. Jack had picked out a
good landing place, for there were trees in
plenty, under which they could make themselves
comfortable.</p>

<p>“Do you think they have noticed us across
there on board the monitor?” Buster asked, as
they stepped ashore.</p>

<p>“It would be strange if they hadn’t,” Josh
told him. “Of course, they can see all that goes
on up and down the river, and we were in plain
sight. Jack, did you expect they might have
a pair of field glasses leveled on us, and was
that why you had the brother and sister keep
inside the cabin lately?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the skipper, “I saw something
flash over there while the sun was shining
through that rift in the clouds, and I got the
idea they might be using their binoculars. You
see, if they should send over to interview us,
and the two Serbians were absent from the
camp, as we mean they shall be, what could we
say if asked about them? That was why I
wanted them to keep out of sight, while the
four of us remained in full view.”</p>

<p>Josh did not say anything further, but the
look of admiration he gave Jack told what his
thoughts were. In his mind the other could not
be equalled when it came to covering the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
ground and laying out extensive plans, for
Jack seemed to be able to grasp everything.</p>

<p>“We must keep a watch out on the river and
try to be on our guard,” continued the leader.
“If they send a boat over here to investigate,
we ought to know about it before the men have
a chance to land and spy on our camp.”</p>

<p>The boat was tied up, and Buster had already
taken ashore all he needed for the evening
meal; while Josh was making a fire in the
midst of some stones he had collected in a sort
of cairn.</p>

<p>The day had ended in a dismal fashion for
one starting out so bravely with blue skies and
plenty of warm sunshine. Out over the water
the haze was thickening, so that when George
gave place to Josh later on it was next door to
impossible to tell where the Austrian monitor
was anchored.</p>

<p>“I’ve lined it up with this stone here and
that tree out on the little point,” George explained;
“the boat lies almost directly with the
two, so if you happen to see any light over there
you’ll know what it means, Josh,” he told the
other, as he gave up his post.</p>

<p>“As long as you could see the monitor, were
there any signs of a boat leaving?” he asked;
but George shook his head and told him he had
seen nothing suspicious.</p>

<small>UNDER COVER OF NIGHT</small></h2>


<p>Some time later, when George again relieved
Josh at the outlook post, the latter came strolling
up to the little fire to get his supper, of
which he was in need, for Josh had a pretty
healthy appetite that seldom went back on him.</p>

<p>“One thing sure,” he remarked, as he sat
himself down and prepared to have Buster
wait on him, “when you told me, Jack, to build
this fire so it couldn’t be easily seen from out
on the river, you knew what you were talking
about.”</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked the commodore simply,
“my idea at the time was to avoid having the
light noticed too easily by any one who happened
to be on the water. Yes, and I hoped to
keep the people on that monitor a mile and
more away from wanting to pay us a visit too
early in the night.”</p>

<p>“It might break up our plans all right if
they did come,” agreed Josh, lifting his tincup
to his lips and proceeding to let some of the
fine coffee pass down his throat as a “bracer”
or opening of ceremonies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“As long as you stayed out there at the
point, did you see or hear anything suspicious,
Josh?” Buster wanted to know, when he
handed the platter, heaped up with good
things, to the late-comer.</p>

<p>“Never a sign all the time I stood sentry,”
came the reply, though Josh had a little difficulty
in talking and eating at the same time.
“But please let me take the edge off my ferocious
appetite before you throw any more questions
at me, fellows. I’ll be in a more angelic
humor then, mebbe.”</p>

<p>“Angelic&mdash;that’s pretty rich for you, Josh,”
gurgled Buster; but, having enough sympathy
for a hungry chum to know how Josh felt, he
maintained a discreet silence after that.</p>

<p>Jack walked over to the near-by shore. He
wanted to find out for himself how matters
seemed to be going.</p>

<p>“Hello! That you, Jack?” said a voice suddenly,
when he found himself close to the brim
of the river.</p>

<p>It had become so dark by this time, the moon
not having as yet arisen behind the clouds, that
seeing was next to impossible. George, however,
had heard footsteps somewhere close by,
and guessed who was coming.</p>

<p>“Yes, where are you, George? Oh, I see
you, now that you move. That’s the boat just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
beyond you, too. Everything lovely with
you?”</p>

<p>“I heard something across the river that
sounded as if it might be a boat being lowered
that struck against the side of the monitor.
Then there were voices, too. You know how
queer sounds come across a mile or more of
water, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course I do. But if it was a boat
being lowered we’ll have to change our plans
somewhat,” Jack continued.</p>

<p>“By that you mean get away from here
sooner?” queried the vidette.</p>

<p>“Just what I do, George.”</p>

<p>“Suppose now it was a boat being put in the
water that I heard, though I may have been
mistaken; how long would it take them to row
over here, do you think?” George asked next.</p>

<p>“That depends on how hard they handled
the oars,” said Jack. “It could hardly be less
than half an hour at the best, I should say.
You see, the monitor lies down-stream from
here, so they’d have to first of all work against
the strong current before crossing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and then again it might be they’d try
to keep us from hearing them coming all they
could, Jack, which would mean they couldn’t
put all their strength into the work.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got the right idea, George; so we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
can have something like half an hour to get
away in. It may turn out to be a false alarm
after all, but we can’t afford to take any
chances.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed the other briskly, for a
wonder, never dreaming of offering any objection.
“The sooner we’re abroad on the river
the better. Then again, before the old moon
comes up behind the clouds, we’ll have it pitch
dark. That ought to help us a lot about slipping
past without getting caught.”</p>

<p>“Stay here, and keep on listening, George.”</p>

<p>“Are you going back to get the rest of the
crowd, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Yes. As soon as Josh has finished his supper
we had better go aboard again and shove
off,” he was informed.</p>

<p>“But say, tell me how you expect to work it,
please Jack, before you go.”</p>

<p>“If you mean the boat, that’s a simple
thing,” the skipper told him. “You know
we’ve got a strong push-pole that’s a pretty
good length? Well, I took soundings as we
came in toward the shore, and found that the
river is fairly shallow around here. With that
pole we can push out into the stream quite a
little distance. Then we’ll just lie low and
let her float on the current.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, I sort of expected that would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the programme,” said George; “and I certainly
agree with you there. Silence is our
best asset in a game like this. We’d feel pretty
cheap and small after getting well started if
all of a sudden some one called out of the darkness:
‘Tag&mdash;you’re it!’”</p>

<p>George, finding Jack had slipped away
meanwhile, and that he was merely talking to
empty space, drew the line at wasting his
breath in this manner, and relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>When Jack got back to the little fire he
found that, short though the time had been,
Josh had made rapid headway with his supper.
The pannikin was already more than half
empty, and that must be his third cup of coffee
Buster was pouring out for him.</p>

<p>Everybody looked up as Jack came into
camp.</p>

<p>“You’ll have just five minutes more, Josh, to
finish your supper,” was the first thing the
other said as he joined them.</p>

<p>Josh looked surprised.</p>

<p>“What! so soon?” he exclaimed, and then
started in to devour his food ravenously, as
though determined to make the best of the limited
time.</p>

<p>Buster laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Josh, you make me think of that old, old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
fellow who had his gravestone cut, and kept it
in the house for about thirty years. The neighbors
were wild with curiosity to know what he
had put on the same, leaving a blank for the
date of his departure. After he was buried
every one flocked to the cemetery to read it.
And this was what they found chiseled in the
stone: ‘I expected this&mdash;but not so soon!’”</p>

<p>Josh did not make any reply. He was indeed
too busy to even laugh just then, for in his
mind the seconds were trooping past, and it
went against his grain to waste good food.</p>

<p>When three minutes had passed he was
ready. Meanwhile Jack had glanced around
to make sure they left nothing behind them in
the shape of a blanket or cooking utensil, none
of which he felt they could spare.</p>

<p>“There, I’m all ready for business!” announced
Josh, climbing to his feet, for he was
really too full of supper to move with his accustomed
agility.</p>

<p>“Everybody get hold of something, then,”
said Jack, “and we’ll head for the boat. I’ll
scatter the fire last of all. That’s the true
hunter way, you know, never to leave a fire
burning behind, because a wind may come up
and scatter the red ashes among the dead
leaves. Many a forest fire has sprung from
just that folly. But in our case we’ve got another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
reason for wanting to kill the blaze; it
may keep some people guessing to know what’s
become of us.”</p>

<p>Presently all this had been accomplished,
and they were heading, Indian file, toward the
river bank. Josh led the way, laden down with
things. Then came the Serbian boy, and his
little sister, who clung to him through it all;
after them Buster stumbled with his customary
awkwardness, while Jack brought up
the rear to make sure that no one strayed from
the line.</p>

<p>They soon arrived at the edge of the bank,
where George joined them. Buster, as he
looked anxiously out at the bank of gloom
marking the river, felt a strange sensation taking
possession of him. It was not fear, though
possibly the feeling could be likened to awe.</p>

<p>“Makes me think of the smugglers landing
on the coast of England, and trying to evade
the revenue officers with their casks of spirits,”
he whispered to Josh.</p>

<p>Somehow, although as yet Jack had said
nothing on that score, even Buster seemed to
realize that there was great need for caution,
which was why he lowered his voice in the way
he did.</p>

<p>The next thing was to get aboard the boat.
Jack saw to it first of all that the brother and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
sister were safe, and then urged Buster to follow
suit.</p>

<p>“Josh, I’m going to appoint you to the honor
task,” he went on to say softly.</p>

<p>“Good for you, Jack,” came the low reply;
“just tell me what I’m to do?”</p>

<p>“George will go aboard with me, for we want
to get the push-pole handy. When I give a
whistle, unfasten the cable and shove her off,
climbing over the side yourself the best way
you can. Get that, Josh?”</p>

<p>“Just my style, boss,” he heard the other
say as he started toward the tree to which the
strong rope was attached.</p>

<p>Jack had examined his chart many times
lately, so that he knew just where they must be
on the river. The Danube takes a sharp turn
toward the east at Belgrade, and here the Save
River empties into the larger stream. On the
same shore that the little party had chosen for
their landing lies the Austrian town of Semlin;
and here on the heights strong fortifications
have long menaced the Serbian capital,
as well as other batteries further along the
Danube.</p>

<p>It would be impossible for them to land
above Belgrade in order to let their passengers
go ashore, so on this account it was necessary
that they take the two with them while running
the batteries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack had regretted this, because he did not
like the idea of that innocent child sharing
their danger; still, so far as he could see, there
was nothing else to be done. The Serb begged
him not to think of abandoning them while on
hostile territory. He had explained by gestures
and pictures that his father had been a
general in the Serbian army, and on account of
the hatred borne for his family by the Hungarians
he felt sure something terrible would
happen if they fell into the hands of the enemy
and their identity were discovered.</p>

<p>When Jack had everything in readiness for
their hasty departure he gave the low whistle
for which Josh on shore was impatiently waiting.
They could hear him pulling the cable
from around the tree trunk; then it came
aboard, and Josh started pushing the boat off.</p>

<p>This required no great effort, for the water
was sufficient to float such a small craft comfortably.
Having managed to get the boat
started, Josh clambered aboard and, being a
nimble fellow, even though far from himself
after that hearty supper, he contrived to accomplish
this without any particular noise.</p>

<p>“We’re off!” said George softly, but with
considerable satisfaction, as he felt the motorboat
moving under the impetus Jack was giving
to the push-pole.</p>

<p>“Bully!” echoed Buster, though at the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
he probably hardly knew whether he could call
himself satisfied or not; for he realized that
they were taking more or less desperate
chances in trying to slip down the river when
two hostile armies were spread along the opposite
banks watching for any sign of a surprise
and doubtless ready to start a hot fire at the
first indication of a crossing being attempted.</p>

<p>This was especially true of the Serbians, for
they knew that an invasion of their territory
was planned by the Austrian army, backed by
heavy artillery.</p>

<p>Jack continued to handle that pole with more
or less ability. It was no new task for him.
Any one who goes much upon the water in
motorboats learns the value of a good pole,
especially when the cruise leads through
swampy sections, where it is no uncommon
thing to be mired and need other help than that
afforded by the unreliable engine.</p>

<p>The current began to make itself felt almost
immediately they were off. It was Jack’s intention
to keep on using his pole until he could
no longer touch bottom. When that time arrived
they would have to let the boat drift with
the current, under the belief that it was apt to
stay fairly well out in the river.</p>

<p>“Listen, everybody,” said Jack about this
time; “from now on silence is going to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
golden rule aboard this craft. Don’t say a
single word unless you have to, and then whisper
it. That applies to every one.”</p>

<p>The night was fairly quiet about this time,
at least there was no firing from the batteries
on the banks of the Danube, though thousands
upon thousands of armed men kept watch
there, ready to lock arms in a fierce battle when
the time came.</p>

<p>Long had this feeling of bitter enmity lain
deep down in the hearts of Austrian and Serb.
The dual monarchy had for many years looked
upon the smaller kingdom as a tempting morsel
that some day she hoped to engulf into her
capacious maw, just as had been done in the
case of Bosnia and other countries now forming
parts of the Austrian patchwork of many
tongues and many people, all under the rule of
Francis Joseph. And now at last war had
actually broken out, so that the scores of many
years would all have a chance of being settled
before peace came again to distracted Europe.</p>

<p>Deeper grew the water, so that Jack was beginning
to find some difficulty in reaching bottom.
This meant that presently there would
be no further need of the push-pole, for they
would have gotten out far enough to let the
stream carry them along.</p>

<p>It was about this time that sounds came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
stealing over the water, causing fresh alarm.
All of them could make out the distinct creak
of oars in rowlocks, being worked with a steady
rhythm that told of experienced hands in the
unseen boat.</p>

<p>Then the next thing they heard was a low
muttered word of command, which came from
exactly the same quarter as the other noise.</p>

<p>A boat was passing toward the shore they
had recently left. It must have come from
over the river, and, as the monitor lay in
that quarter, evidently those who had been sent
out to investigate the status of the motorboat
party had seen fit to pull straight across first,
intending to follow the trend of the shore up to
the camp.</p>

<p>Jack had reason to believe they would pass
down before the hostile boat drew close enough
for any one to make them out; nevertheless, his
heart seemed to cease beating for the moment,
such was the intense anxiety that seized upon
him.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>AMIDST BURSTING SHELLS</small></h2>


<p>Jack did not even dare attempt to draw the
push-pole up out of the water, lest he manage
in some fashion to strike it against the side of
the boat, and in this way draw the attention of
the enemy.</p>

<p>Everything depended on luck&mdash;and the current
of the river. If this latter proved strong
enough to draw the motorboat far enough
away, so that its outlines could not be distinguished
by those in the rowboat, all might yet
be well. Certainly if hearty wishes could accomplish
anything this end was likely to be
achieved, for every one aboard was hoping it
would come to pass.</p>

<p>Jack soon began to breathe easier. He felt
sure the boat would pass back of them, and at
a sufficient distance to avoid discovery, unless
something unexpected came about to betray
their presence. A sneeze just then would have
ruined everything; and Buster felt a cold chill
pass over him when he had such an inclination.
He managed to ward the desire off by rubbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
both sides of his nose violently, just as he had
been taught to do by his mother when in
church.</p>

<p>So the sounds died out, and they now heard
nothing save the gurgle of the water or the
sighing of the summer breeze among the treetops
on shore.</p>

<p>Far away across the river he caught sight of
a light. It was low down and close to the
water, so Jack could easily guess it marked the
spot where the Austrian monitor lay anchored.</p>

<p>Upon making another trial with the pole
Jack found it possible to still touch bottom. As
it was his desire to keep on pressing out as far
as they could go, so as to approach near the
middle of the river, he continued to exert himself.
Every yard gained counted for just so
much, and now was the time to do it. Later on
the opportunity would have passed, and it
might be too late.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the point where the
Save joined forces with the Danube it was expected
that the influence of this new flow of
water would add to the swiftness of their
passage.</p>

<p>Jack knew that it would be an hour of greatest
anxiety while they remained in the region
dominated by those big guns. At any minute
they might be discovered by some unlucky accident,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
such as the moon coming out from her
concealment, or the breeze rising so as to carry
away the gathering fog.</p>

<p>He had everything ready so that the engine
could be started up instantly should they have
reason to believe they were seen from the Austrian
shore. As a last resort he was intending
to make for the Serbian bank, in hopes of finding
shelter there. At least, if captured by the
Serbs, they would be treated decently, once the
identity of their passengers had been learned.</p>

<p>The minutes crept slowly past.</p>

<p>All they could do was to sit there and turn
their heads to look eagerly first this way and
then that.</p>

<p>Feeling a tug at his sleeve, Jack turned toward
Josh, who was closest to him.</p>

<p>“Look yonder; there are lights, Jack!”
whispered the other in his ear.</p>

<p>Jack guessed that this must be Belgrade,
though at the time the Serbian capital, being
the subject of bombardment, lay almost in
darkness, so that the vigilant foe across the
river might not have the range.</p>

<p>Somehow it interested Jack deeply to see
those few meager lights where at other times
the sky might have blazed with the electric
glow, for Belgrade was always a little Paris of
the Balkans. It seemed to speak of the terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
results that must follow in the train of a brutal
war, civilization giving way to barbarity.</p>

<p>And there off to the right must be the Save
River, flowing from far up in the region between
the Croatian and the Bosnian provinces
of Austria.</p>

<p>Back of this stream he knew there were
heavy fortifications dominating the distant
Serbian capital. It would seem that Austria
had taken particular pains to threaten her fiery
little neighbor on the south, possibly in hopes
of some day stirring up another hornets’ nest
in the Balkans, through which she might attain
her selfish ends and annex new territory.</p>

<p>As their course did not lie in that direction
Jack bothered himself not at all in connection
with the Save batteries. He was, however,
deeply interested in the ones he knew were
located upon the lower heights. What peril
they must face would spring from this source.</p>

<p>It was perhaps only natural that just then
Jack should suddenly remember what had been
said about searchlights. He wondered whether
any were in use in this section of the fighting
zone. Germans, French and British would
certainly have carried such necessary appliances
with them, but it was uncertain whether
the Serbs or the Austrians had seen fit to install
them here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Now they seemed to be sweeping around the
bend in the river. Jack could feel a new motion
to the boat, which he believed must come
from the addition of the Save waters to those
of the Danube.</p>

<p>He watched both shores alternately. It was
almost impossible to make out anything except
where some height was dimly outlined against
the clouded sky line. Then he turned his eyes
aloft. The moon had risen, for in the east it
was light compared to the west, though nothing
of her silvery disc could be discovered.</p>

<p>Would the clouds continue to befriend the
fugitives of the Danube through the dangerous
passage of the batteries? If there came a
break above even for a brief interval it might
spell ruin for their hopes. And so Jack hoped
most fervently that the clouds would prove
merciful and keep on shutting off that light
which, coming at an unfortunate moment,
might mean their betrayal.</p>

<p>Without the slightest warning there came a
sudden fearful sound. At the same instant
they saw a vivid flash far back on the Austrian
heights. Seconds followed, marked by the accelerated
pulsations of their hearts. Then followed
a crash and a flash over the place where
the boys knew the capital lay in darkness and
gloom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>The bombardment of Belgrade had begun
again. Some plan of campaign was being followed
out that had to do with either the utter
destruction of the city or else the rout of its
defenders, so that a hostile army could make
the crossing in safety, something they did not
dare attempt as long as the Serbs remained in
their trenches awaiting their coming.</p>

<p>The mere fact of its being night made no
difference. Long ago the Austrians had undoubtedly
platted everything out and secured
the range for their big guns on the heights back
of the river. They could fire just as accurately
in utter darkness as in broad daylight, for the
shells were hurled with mathematical precision,
each one being timed to explode at a certain
second.</p>

<p>As if that first shot were looked upon as a
defiance, several Serb guns took up the challenge.
It was inspiring to see the shells burst
like giant skyrockets far up on the heights.
Evidently others besides the Austrians had occupied
their spare time in getting distances all
down to a fine point, for the Serbian gunners
managed to drop their projectiles in given
places, where they threatened to smash some of
the tremendous war engines of the enemy.</p>

<p>The boys knew that it was much too late for
them to think of turning back now. In fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
such a thing was utterly impossible, much as
they might have wished it. All they could do
was to keep on floating down the river, trusting
in their customary good luck to escape
harm.</p>

<p>They could hear strange noises as the reverberations
died out, which Jack knew must be
made by the whizzing shells far above them.
It gave him a thrill to realize the fact that he
and his three chums were thus brought into the
very whirlwind of war, with deadly engines of
destruction busy on all sides of them.</p>

<p>Even the anchored monitor several miles up
the river joined in the music, for that partly
muffled roar seemed to come from the direction
they knew her to be in.</p>

<p>The two passengers had remained perfectly
silent all this while, though their faces kept
turned toward the spot where they knew the
darkened city must lie. It was easy for Jack
to imagine what their thoughts must be at such
a time as this. No one could say how long this
bombardment had been going on, or what sort
of damage the terrible shells exploding may
have done among the numerous fine buildings
of the Serbian capital.</p>

<p>By now it might be lying a mass of ruins for
aught they knew; and somewhere in the midst
their mother had been living the last they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
heard from her. Yes, Jack could easily appreciate
what agonies of mind the couple must
be enduring as they crouched there in each
other’s arms, and with throbbing hearts listened
to the hoarse crash of the opposing guns,
the one friendly and the other freighted with
hatred and animosity.</p>

<p>There was, of course, no danger to the party
on the motorboat from the shells that were
passing so high overhead, describing a parabola
in their flight, something after the manner
of a rainbow. Jack’s fears were along other
lines.</p>

<p>If, as he suspected, this night bombardment
on the part of the Austrian batteries was meant
to occupy the attention of their foes while a
force of troops was being ferried over the river
or a temporary bridge made of pontoons and
planks thrown across, it would mean that
sooner or later the fugitives must be brought
up with a round turn and find themselves
caught in a trap.</p>

<p>One shell burst prematurely, and almost
overhead, giving them a severe shock, for the
sound was deafening. All of them involuntarily
dropped down and held their breath in
suspense. Then they heard missiles striking
the water all around with an angry hiss, some
of them terribly close.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing doing!” muttered Josh, when the
fusillade had stopped and it became evident
that they had escaped being struck.</p>

<p>“It was a narrow escape, all the same,” said
Jack, with deep gratitude in his voice, though
at the same time he remembered to keep his
tones low.</p>

<p>All of them were fervently hoping there
would be no more short fuses with the shells
that were screaming overhead. It was bad
enough to be passing underneath such a rain
of fire without incurring the added peril of
being unintentionally struck.</p>

<p>Back and forth the duel continued. The
Serbian gunners were evidently bent on giving
as good as they received. They also hoped, no
doubt, to make things so warm up there on the
heights that the Austrians would cease firing
in order to save their guns from being dismounted.</p>

<p>Every yard counted for the fugitives. Hope
grew stronger in the heart of Buster as they
continued to glide along on the bosom of the
river and nothing happened to disturb this
feeling of increasing confidence. He really began
to believe, perhaps for the first time, that
they were going, after all, to float beyond the
dangerous zone and find safety below.</p>

<p>As he afterwards declared, Buster lived
years during that period of suspense. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
seemed to him that minutes must be hours, for
each one was fraught with such unlimited possibilities
of evil that such things as seconds
were not to be reckoned with at all.</p>

<p>The friendly clouds still held the moon from
coming forth to betray them, and it was undoubtedly
true that they were passing the
worst of the line of bombardment. Given just
a certain amount of time and they could count
themselves safe from that source of danger.</p>

<p>There remained the possibility of coming
upon the Austrian forces below starting to
bridge the river or cross on boats.</p>

<p>Jack believed that it was not wise for a white
man to shout until he was fully out of the
woods. While the prospect certainly looked
hopeful, he would not allow himself to believe
the danger was over until many more miles had
been passed.</p>

<p>Between Belgrade and the Iron Gate, which
latter is situated at the junction of Austria,
Serbia and Rumania, there is a stretch of river
nearly a hundred miles in extent. Here the
Danube makes another sharp turn amidst wonderful
scenery, and for a long distance forms
the boundary between Serbia and Rumania.</p>

<p>Jack realized full well that they could not
count themselves free from peril until they
saw the shore of Rumania on their left. He
hardly knew whether it would be wise for them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
to try and make progress during daylight, for
they might be picked up at any time by Austrian
soldiers afloat on the river, or made the
target of concealed guns ashore, under the impression
that the motorboat must belong to
Serbs.</p>

<p>Josh, being an ardent chap and easily influenced
by outer appearances, actually believed
everything was going the right way, and that
they had escaped from the jaws of another
dilemma. Only for Jack’s caution he would
very likely have been inclined to voice his delight
in some boisterous way; but he did not
dare give his feelings full sway.</p>

<p>So far the current had done all they could
have asked. It had swept the boat onward
persistently, and without any sound to betray
them. Before now, doubtless, those men from
the anchored monitor must have found where
they had built their little cooking fire and
learned that the mysterious motorboat had
vanished, either down the river or back again
whence it came. Jack was not bothering himself
in the least about the things that were
gone. The wheel of the mill would never turn
again with the water that was past, according
to his notion.</p>

<p>He kept looking ahead all the time. Something
was bothering him, undoubtedly, for
Josh discovered that the skipper had his hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
up to his ear, as though trying to add to his
powers of hearing.</p>

<p>“What is it, Jack?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“I saw lights below, moving lights, and
something is going on, I’m afraid,” Jack told
him. “The sound of the guns deadens everything.
I believe it is being kept up on purpose
to hide something else. See, you can catch the
lights I spoke about now.”</p>

<p>“Say, I thought I caught something like
hammering just then, Jack,” said the other in
fresh excitement. “Do you think the Austrians
can be trying to get some of their troops
across the river under cover of the darkness
and fog?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been afraid we’d find that was the
meaning of all the firing,” Jack answered.
“The Austrians don’t dare try it in broad daylight,
but hope to push enough men over to-night
to hold a bridge-head, and then follow
with their field artillery.”</p>

<p>“But what would they try to do, cross on
boats, Jack?”</p>

<p>“If that was hammering we really heard,”
came the reply, “then it means they are trying
to spread a pontoon bridge across the Danube.
Long before dawn they could land thousands
of men with many guns on the Serbian side of
the river.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>THE SMASHING OF THE PONTOON BRIDGE</small></h2>


<p>“It must be a bridge they’re building,” said
Josh presently, “because just then I saw a
light move along, as if held by some one who
was running.”</p>

<p>Sounds began to reach them at the same
time, which were very significant. On the
whole Jack realized that there could no longer
be the slightest doubt about the fact that the
Austrians were pushing out a pontoon bridge
with all the haste they could throw into the undertaking.</p>

<p>Already they seemed to be much more than
half-way across the river, having, no doubt,
selected a place where it was not unusually
wide. And what were the Serbs doing all this
while? Had they been caught napping, so that
when the dawn broke the enemy would have
secured a firm footing on the southern bank of
the disputed river and could move the balance
of his forces across at his leisure?</p>

<p>It looked that way, though Jack doubted it
very much. From what he had read and heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of the people of the smaller kingdom he believed
they were too smart not to see through
the device of the enemy. He rather fancied
they were in force somewhere in the darkness
shrouding the southern bank, and that just
when the Austrians were congratulating themselves
on having met with splendid success
something was scheduled to happen calculated
to give the invaders a surprise.</p>

<p>Jack realized that it was folly for them to
continue down the river. If the pontoon
bridge had already reached a point three-quarters
of the way across, the workers on it would
quickly discover the oncoming motorboat. Indeed,
the chances were the craft must bump up
against one of the pontoons and could get no
further.</p>

<p>This would be bad enough, but Jack fancied
there was something ten times more dreadful
awaiting them if they reached the swaying
structure. Should the waiting Serbs conclude
the time had come to put an end to this bridge
building, a hurricane of shot and shell would
be hurled across the scanty water separating
them from the shore, and few there would be
who could escape the rain of missiles.</p>

<p>That was no place for neutrals, Jack decided.
The only thing that remained for them to do
was to make speedily for the shore. To accomplish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
this desired end it would be necessary for
them to start up the engine at once, though
Jack meant to keep the muffler in place and cut
out all the noise he could, not wishing to draw
attention to that quarter.</p>

<p>That was where the benefit of preparedness
came in handy. It took him but three seconds
to accomplish what he wanted to do. Following
the cranking there came a series of explosions
that were not very loud, and immediately
the boat started off at a lively clip.</p>

<p>Every one waited with more or less nervousness
to see if anything happened, but not a shot
was fired. Those at work on the swinging
bridge were in too feverish a condition of making
haste to bother about a few spluttering
sounds like that; while the concealed Serbs, if
there were really any such near by, did not
want to disclose the fact of their presence in
the vicinity by doing anything prematurely.</p>

<p>Jack immediately swung the boat around
and headed up-stream again. He fancied they
were a little too close to the pontoon bridge-builders
for safety if anything did happen, as
he fully expected would be the case.</p>

<p>When he had gone a short distance he headed
for the southern shore, meaning to come to the
land and stay there until something was decided,
one way or the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“Slow up, Jack!” exclaimed Josh, who was
shading his eyes with his hand, though more
from habit than because he thought it aided
him in seeing. “We’re close to the bank now.”</p>

<p>Cutting off the power, Jack allowed the boat
to glide forward. George had taken up the
push-pole, and with this he proceeded to help
things along. So they presently came into
shallow water and ran aground close to the
shore, which stood out above them against the
gray sky, there being something of a small
bluff.</p>

<p>So far everything had worked well. Jack
felt they had reason to be more than satisfied
with the progress made. Here they could remain
in secret and await coming events. If the
bridge were finished, and the Austrians commenced
passing over, the boys would have to
make some new plans looking to the future.
Everything depended on the next half hour.</p>

<p>The furious hammering up on the distant
heights across the river still continued, and
Serbian guns answered every shot, so that it
might not appear they were either lacking in
ammunition or courage.</p>

<p>There was a stir in the middle of the boat.
Jack could easily guess that the two passengers
were aware of the fact that they could easily
spring over the side and find their feet pressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
their native soil. Now was the time for
them to go ashore. They could either flee to
the interior or else risk everything in entering
the capital after the bombardment had ceased
once more, in search of the mother, who had
been last heard from there.</p>

<p>The boy gripped each one of them by the
hand. What he said they could not understand,
though it was easy to guess the meaning
of his warm words of thanks. They had each
one of them to kiss the little girl, for Josh
boldly started it and no one wished to be left
out.</p>

<p>After that the Serbian lad jumped over the
side, standing in water up to his ankles, and
lifted his sister to dry ground. The four motorboat
chums saw them no more, but they
would always remember the incident with
pleasure.</p>

<p>After the two had gone Jack breathed more
easily. He felt that he could face the future,
no matter what it had in store for them, with
a better spirit, now that the pretty little girl
had been removed from danger in their company.
Besides, it must always be a source of
satisfaction to himself and mates to remember
that they had been enabled to prove of more or
less assistance to those who were in deep
trouble, with no way out of the difficulty save
by the help of the American lads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder now if the Serbs are asleep at the
switch while all this thing is going on below
here?” George said, after a little more time
had passed, and they could hear the working
human beavers on the pontoon bridge more
plainly than ever.</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it,” Josh told him.
“Look up and see what a splendid ambush this
little bluff would make. Well, take my word
for it, down below there Serbs are crouching
in bunches, waiting with their machine guns
until just when it seems the bridge is going to
be joined with the shore. Then you’ll hear
something drop!”</p>

<p>“My stars!” muttered Buster, “I wouldn’t
want to be one of those poor fellows at work
with those pontoons, not for all the gold in
King Solomon’s mine I wouldn’t. They won’t
have a ghost of a show, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“But we’re far enough away from the place
not to be in danger&mdash;how about that, Jack?”
George went on to say in a cautious tone.</p>

<p>“Only a random shot could come this way, if
the Austrians on the other shore start things
going. I don’t believe they will, because
they’ll be afraid of hitting their own men.”</p>

<p>“This is exciting, all right,” ventured Josh.</p>

<p>“Well, better all keep still again,” Jack remarked;
“we might attract some attention,
you know, and that’s the last thing we want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
do right now. If the bridge is destroyed we
can wait a while until things cool off, and then
try our luck again, dropping down with the
current.”</p>

<p>They kept as well behind the side of the boat
as possible, acting on Jack’s advice, though the
thin shell could hardly serve as a means of
protection in case a projectile of any sort came
that way.</p>

<p>Once more the minutes dragged fearfully,
though their suspense was hardly of the same
personal nature as before. It seemed to Buster
that there was a mine to be exploded out
there on the river, and that those soldiers who
were working feverishly to complete the bridge
must be directly over it. Any second now they
might expect to hear a dreadful crash, and
catch the shouts of those who were in range of
the firing, as well as the rending of the boats
under the rain of missiles.</p>

<p>Nearer still the Austrian bridge builders
were coming. They had been well trained in
their business, those army engineers, and
worked methodically, even while laboring under
a tremendous strain both of body and
mind.</p>

<p>Jack, chancing to come in contact with Buster,
found the other shivering as if he had the
ague. He knew that it was due to agitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
consequent upon excitement. Doubtless the
beads of perspiration were rolling down Buster’s
cheeks at the same time, even though the
night air was rather chilly now instead of being
warm.</p>

<p>Jack was glad he had been wise enough to
come back up the river some little distance before
reaching land. If the Austrian batteries
turned some of their guns on that shore later,
the boys would stand less chance of being hit
when the mighty shells exploded along the
bluff.</p>

<p>“Oh! I wish it was all over with!” groaned
Josh, upon whom the dreadful suspense was
telling terribly.</p>

<p>Hardly had he said this than the very atmosphere
about them seemed to be rent with a
tremendous explosion. A gun had been fired
not far away, for the fire blazed forth from the
little bluff almost over their heads. There was
heard a dreadful rending of planks and boats,
accompanied by shouts and shrieks.</p>

<p>This was the opening gun.</p>

<p>Almost immediately there leaped from the
shore below the boys what looked like a long
zigzag line of fire. Accompanying it came the
discordant grinding of numerous machine
guns, sending a constant stream of missiles out
there upon the swaying pontoon bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>The darkness was for the time being dispelled,
and the boys saw with staring eyes such
a vivid picture as comes seldom in the lives of
any one not a soldier. It fascinated even while
appalling them by its horrible reality.</p>

<p>The constant flashing of the rapid-fire guns
dazzled their eyes, but at the same time they
could see the strange low bridge built upon the
aligned pontoons. It had been hastily but
fairly well constructed, considering that the
workmen had to handle their tools in almost
utter darkness. Instinct and long practice had
to take the place of eyesight.</p>

<p>They were swarming like bees all over the
structure even then, some carrying planks and
others hurrying back for new burdens. Just
on the down-river side the boys could catch
glimpses of many who seemed to be pushing
other pontoons out, by holding on to the part
of the bridge already finished. These they expected
to use in filling the remaining gap between
the present terminus of the bridge and
the intended anchorage on the bank.</p>

<p>Alas! they were never given the opportunity
to carry out their well-laid plans. That hurricane
of lead and iron was sweeping everything
before it. Men were going down by dozens;
some plunged from the bridge into the
river, seeking to take the chances of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
drowned to the certainty of death in that hailstorm
of deadly messengers.</p>

<p>Every conceivable manner of outcry could
be heard. Men shrieked, and shouted, and
probably swore in their own language. They
were sprawled out all over the shuddering
bridge, some crawling, others perfectly still.
It seemed to be a regular shambles the wide-awake
Serbs had made of that promising pontoon
bridge. Instead of being “asleep at the
switch,” as one of the boys had hinted, it
seemed that they had set a sly trap, and simply
bided their time, waiting until the enemy had
almost completed his work before setting out
to demolish it.</p>

<p>Again the boys heard that larger gun somewhere
close by give tongue. As they continued
to stare as though spellbound they saw
that this time the gunner had planned to smash
the bridge half-way across. True had been his
aim, for the missile cut a passage completely
through the pontoons, leaving a gap some four
feet or more wide there.</p>

<p>Josh gave vent to a cry; he could no longer
suppress the emotion that seemed to be overpowering
him. Unless he did something, or
said something, he would begin to believe it
must all be a horrible nightmare.</p>

<p>“Look, oh! look!” was what he exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
shrilly, forgetting all need of caution, for the
guns were still grinding forth with that weird
strain that, once heard, could never be forgotten;
“they’ve smashed the bridge over there
with that shell! This half of it is beginning to
break up and float away with the current. It’s
all going to pieces, I tell you!”</p>

<p>They could see that Josh had not overestimated
the terrible damage that had been
wrought by that cleverly aimed shell. Deprived
of its supports, the near end of the line
of pontoons had already yielded to the drag of
the current and was beginning to pass down-stream.
As it went it also commenced to break
into smaller sections. Here a boat sank, having
been pierced by some of the numerous bits
of flying metal. Again others broke away and
floated off by themselves, often with dead or
living freight.</p>

<p>The whole surface of the water seemed to be
dotted with innumerable fragments of what
only three minutes before had been a splendid
specimen of engineering skill. The Serbs had
waited until just the right time to strike their
blow. They had made it felt, too, for the Austrian
losses must have been terribly severe.
More than that even, the injury to the <em>morale</em>
of the dual kingdom’s troops must have counted
for a whole lot, while renewed confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
would be the portion of the defenders of the
southern bank.</p>

<p>It was almost like a strange dream to some
of the boys. Buster, who had gazed at the
wonderful spectacle with distended eyes, might
have been noticed to pinch himself violently
on the leg, as though hardly able to believe that
he was really awake and looking at such a picture
of war’s horrors.</p>

<p>The firing had mostly stopped by now, only
that big gun sent another shell over, and succeeded
in cutting another third of the pontoons
loose, to be carried down-stream in a state approaching
chaos.</p>

<p>Once again did darkness fall like a merciful
curtain upon the scene. The boys were glad to
have its horrors shut out from their sight.
Never so long as they lived would they be
likely to forget that smashing of the pontoon
bridge.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>THE AFTERMATH OF BATTLE</small></h2>


<p>“Was it real, and did we see that bridge
knocked into flinders?” asked Buster, when
the terrific racket had in the main died out and
it was possible for them to exchange comments
or ask each others’ advice.</p>

<p>“As genuine as anything that ever crossed
our path,” replied Josh. “Ugh! wasn’t it
fierce, though, to see those poor Austrians
crawling like ants all over the old thing when
it began to break up? Some of them were
badly wounded, too. I tell you, we’ll be seeing
that sight many a time when we wake up from
a bad dream.”</p>

<p>“But what are we going to do now, fellows?”
George wanted to know.</p>

<p>“The way is clear again,” suggested Josh,
helplessly.</p>

<p>“And will be right along to-night, unless
those Austrian engineers try to shove out another
lot of their pontoons, to be smashed into
kindling wood,” George said.</p>

<p>“There they begin firing again!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Buster, in a fresh tremor; “oh! I wonder
what’s in the wind now.”</p>

<p>“It’s all from over the river on the Austrian
side, you notice,” Jack remarked, after the
crash of a shell had been heard not a sixth of a
mile below them and apparently close to the
bluff that marked the river’s edge.</p>

<p>“They’re as mad as hops over the smart way
the Serbs knocked their bridge down, seems
like,” suggested Buster.</p>

<p>“That’s where your head’s level, Buster!”
exclaimed Josh; “if they can’t have the game
go their own way they won’t play in the Serbs’
back-yard. So now they’re meaning to shell
the river bank over here.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked the fat chum wonderingly.
“They can’t see a single one of the
Serbs’ batteries, or even a man for that matter.”</p>

<p>“But they’ve located the different spots
where that hot fire came from, and are hoping
to get a few of the enemy guns with their big
shells,” continued Josh, who could always be
depended on to do the explaining when he
grasped a subject himself.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I do hope they won’t drop a
shell over this way and give us a bad scare,”
said Buster.</p>

<p>“That’s a fact; that gun by which the bridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
was cut to pieces did get in its work from near
by here!” added George uneasily.</p>

<p>“I heard men talking and horses whinnying
between the bursts of firing,” said Jack; “so I
reckon they cleared out just as soon as their
work was done. That’s the case, too, all along
the line, the batteries and their supporting
columns falling back to new positions so as to
avoid the bombardment they know mighty well
is going to come.”</p>

<p>Sitting there in the boat, they watched the
fitful flashes of fire on the ridge far back from
the river. It was much more thrilling than
any storm they had ever seen; and then would
come the crash as each enormous shell exploded
on the southern side of the hotly contested
stream that served as the border between
the hostile countries.</p>

<p>Once there was a frightful detonation not
far away from where the boys huddled aboard
the little motorboat. The Austrian gunners
had commenced to send missiles toward the
spot from which the Serb gun had barked.
Doubtless a terrible hole had been knocked in
the bluff, a cavity that looked like a crater resulting
from the explosion.</p>

<p>Every one of them had felt the shock attending
the bursting of the high explosive shell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
though luckily none of the fragments chanced
to scatter in their direction.</p>

<p>“Oh! that was an awful crack!” groaned
Buster, as though his heart might have tried to
jump into his throat and partly choke him. “I
do hope they won’t give us an encore. A hundred
feet further this way and our name would
have been Dennis.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grumbled George, “better say it
would be Mud, because we’d have gone into the
river with tons of the earth here.”</p>

<p>“Listen! The Serbs are replying now!”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“And that gun sounded exactly like the one
that knocked the bridge to bits,” added Josh.</p>

<p>“Let’s hope, then, the fellows across on the
hills there recognize its bark!” George exclaimed
with considerable fervor, “and realize
that it isn’t around this region any longer.
Then they won’t bother wasting any more of
their ammunition in bombarding this place.”</p>

<p>Apparently this was just what happened, for
that shell was not followed by others, much to
the relief of the boys. Buster in his heart even
forgave the Austrians all they had done to
nearly frighten him to death because of their
forbearance now.</p>

<p>“No use wasting your good stuff any more,
Mr. Austrian General,” he announced, “because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the bully little Serbs have been too smart
for you. They shot their bolt and then changed
partners, just like you might do in dancing the
Lancers. So call it off and settle down again.”</p>

<p>The firing still kept up, however.</p>

<p>“They’ve got oceans of ammunition up
there,” remarked George, “and have been just
aching to expend some of it, which is why they
keep on whanging away when they haven’t any
more chance to hit anything than you’d meet
with in finding a needle in a haystack.”</p>

<p>“But they won’t try to keep it up all night
long, I hope?” Buster observed.</p>

<p>“Not much danger of that,” Jack told him,
knowing the other was fretting.</p>

<p>“I wonder if the boy and his kid sister will
manage to get into Belgrade, and also find their
mother alive?” Josh went on to say, showing
that even in the midst of all that horrible confusion
he could let his thoughts stray to the
pair whom they had so generously assisted in
their great trouble.</p>

<p>“We’ll hope so, anyway,” George added, for
he, too, had been greatly drawn to the winsome
little lassie with the bright eyes, now able to
see as well as any one.</p>

<p>“I can see lights moving across the river and
low down,” announced the keen-eyed Josh just
then, and his words gave Buster a thrill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“My stars! I wonder if those stubborn
Austrians are meaning to tackle the job again
and try a second bridge? They may have a
new lot of pontoons, you know, and want to
use them. Some people never can take a hint,
it seems, and that one from the Serbs was as
strong as anything could be. ‘No trespass’ was
the sign they nailed to that bridge when they
scattered it over the water.”</p>

<p>“‘Keep off the grass,’ you’d better say,
Buster,” corrected Josh whimsically.</p>

<p>“I hardly think they’re reckless enough to
make another attempt at this place to-night,”
Jack told them. “When they get ready to try
again it will be in a locality further removed
from Belgrade. They can always hope to
catch the Serbs off their guard, you know.”</p>

<p>“But then what are those lights moving
around over there for?” demanded Buster.</p>

<p>“You can see others further down the river
in the bargain,” Josh explained. “In my
humble opinion they’re looking up their
wounded, and trying to pick up any who managed
to swim ashore below.”</p>

<p>“You notice that the Serbs are not interfering
with them at all,” Jack continued, “which
goes to show they believe just as Josh here said,
and that it’s the Red Cross corps working
along the river bank.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess the Serbs feel satisfied with what
they’ve done to-night,” was George’s comment.
“Not only have they smashed the bridge of the
Austrians, but must have killed and wounded
hundreds of the enemy. All this with little loss
to themselves. It’s going to make them feel
their oats, let me tell you.”</p>

<p>“Still Austria is so powerful that sooner or
later a force three times as big as the Serbian
army can be thrown across the Danube to invade
the country. When it does come to that,
though,” added Josh, “I give you my word for
it, they’ll fight like tigers.”</p>

<p>“You notice that the firing is dying down
again, don’t you?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>Only an occasional shot still sounded. When
it did come the deep grumbling echoes rumbled
back and forth between the opposing heights
until they died away in softer cadence in the
distance.</p>

<p>“How will we go from here, Jack?” questioned
George. “Will it be safe to start up the
engine while we’re so close by?”</p>

<p>“I was studying that very thing, George,”
replied the other, “and had about made up my
mind that it would be much better for us to repeat
what we did before.”</p>

<p>“That means push out with the pole, and let
the boat float on the current, eh, Jack?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“After we get a mile or two further down
the river we can think of using a little power
and increasing our speed. But this is dangerous
ground, you know,” was what the skipper
went on to say.</p>

<p>Buster knew that the time was coming, and
very soon now, when they would again be on
the move. He was glad of it, and yet at the
same time viewed the approaching change of
base with fresh anxiety. So many perils
seemed to yawn in front of them, and all with
ominous aspect.</p>

<p>He stared out upon the darkened river,
though, of course, it was little he could see.
Still, to Buster just then it was peopled with
enemies of every type, men in boats moving
around seeking trouble, and ready to strike
hard at the first sign of opposition.</p>

<p>Buster found himself between the two horns
of a dilemma; he wanted to get away from
there, and at the same time hated to incur
fresh perils. As generally happened with him,
in the end he decided to put himself entirely
in the hands of his three mates and let them
settle the matter as they thought fit.</p>

<p>Which was possibly the best thing Buster
could have done.</p>

<p>By the time another ten minutes had crept
past Jack began to bestir himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is it time?” asked Buster dubiously.</p>

<p>“The firing seems to have stopped entirely,”
he was told, “and if that’s the case, the sooner
we’re out of here the better.”</p>

<p>Of course, there would be Serb sentries
posted all along the river bank, unseen in the
darkness, but ever vigilant to detect and report
anything suspicious that might take place. On
the other hand, some of the Austrians might
have put out in boats stationed below on purpose,
meaning to search for wounded men
among the floating fragments of the pontoon
bridge.</p>

<p>Once Jack put some of his strength into his
work and they could feel the boat gliding away
from the shoal water where they had been lying
quietly for such a length of time.</p>

<p>Buster drew a long breath, and tried to
pierce the gloom by which they were surrounded.
If there was anything he hated it
was that sense of impending evil, with not the
slightest chance to ward it off. Still he got a
grip on himself, and determined that if the
others could stand it he must do the same.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>A RESCUE BY THE WAY</small></h2>


<p>As soon as they were out a short distance
from the shore the ever-present current took
hold of the boat, and they found that they were
beginning to move down the river.</p>

<p>Jack worked hard at his task. He knew it
would be to their advantage to get as far away
from the bank as possible before passing the
places where the Serbs had lain in ambush.
There would be less danger of their presence
on the water being discovered in that case.</p>

<p>Josh hovered near by. Unable to resist the
temptation, he finally took hold of the pole
while Jack was pushing, and “leaned on it” in
a way to render considerable assistance.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to be working in a satisfactory
manner so far as making good progress
went. If it kept up for a few minutes more
Jack believed they would have achieved their
end.</p>

<p>A single shot coming from further down the
river on the northern bank gave him some
little cause for uneasiness lest the fierce bombardment
break out again. It proved to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
false alarm, since nothing followed, the Serbs
never even taking the trouble to respond to the
invitation. They had taken up new positions,
and apparently were averse to letting the
enemy “feel them out.”</p>

<p>Now they must have reached the place where
the swaying bridge made of heavy planks laid
upon successive pontoon boats had a short
while before been in the process of completion.</p>

<p>It gave the boys a queer sensation to remember
this. Over the spot which they were now
passing had swept that hurricane of missiles,
mowing down the engineers engaged in bridge
building as though they might be wheat falling
before the reaper.</p>

<p>All was clear now, not a sign of the recent
dreadful engagement being visible. Further
down the river doubtless there would be met
with fragments of the wrecked bridge. Jack
knew that later on they would have to keep on
the lookout for all such obstacles to a safe
passage; but there would be little or no danger
up to the time they started the engine and increased
their pace.</p>

<p>About that time, when all of them felt exceedingly
nervous over the possibility of being
fired upon, possibly Buster may not have been
the only one of the little party who called himself
a fool for having accepted this risk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>It was too late now for vain regrets, however;
they had made their beds and must lie
in them.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re past that awful place, anyway,”
whispered Buster presently; and no
doubt, while the others did not echo his words,
they felt just about as the stout chum did.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” Josh was saying cautiously,
“the way that bridge went to pieces made me
think of a house of cards when you blow at it.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t talk any more just now,”
asked Jack; “we’re still too close to the bank,
and you might be heard.”</p>

<p>“Correct!” said Josh, which in his vernacular
was as much as asking Jack to excuse his
break.</p>

<p>After they had floated along for some time,
and Jack figured that they must by then have
covered all of two miles, he decided it would be
safe to start the engine. Of course, this could
not be done without more or less popping and
similar noise, try the best he was able; but
Jack figured that the Serbs would not open fire
for several good and sufficient reasons.</p>

<p>In the first place, they knew they had nothing
to fear from one small launch, no matter if
it were an enemy craft. Then again, as the
Austrian Red Cross was undoubtedly searching
for victims of that fusillade, there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
chance that this might be one of their units
pursuing a mission of mercy.</p>

<p>Accordingly Jack started things up.</p>

<p>The engine responded readily to treatment,
much to the satisfaction of Buster, who had
been entertaining serious fears. The motor
had proved tricky on one other occasion, he
remembered, and on this account he wondered
what they would ever do should it go back on
them again.</p>

<p>They were now in the war zone, and it would
hardly be possible to get repairs made and secure
permission to continue down the Danube
on their cruise.</p>

<p>Of course, Jack did not think to put on a full
head of power; that would hardly have been
wise while they were apt to come upon floating
remnants of the bridge at any time.</p>

<p>“Josh, you can help me now if you want to,”
he presently told the other.</p>

<p>“Give your orders, then, Commodore.”</p>

<p>“Crawl up forward, and keep as close a
watch on the water as you can,” Jack told him.
“I mean directly in front of us, because it
might get us in trouble if we ran smack into
one of those pontoons out here in the middle of
the river.”</p>

<p>“I get your meaning, all right,” responded
Josh, starting to carry the plan out. “I’ll call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
myself the lookout man, and signal you to back
her in case I see any sign of trouble ahead.”</p>

<p>“Give a sharp whistle, and I’ll know what
that means,” the skipper told him.</p>

<p>So Josh crept past Jack and sprawled there
in the extreme bow. He possessed good eyesight,
and was likely to discover any floating
object long before they were in danger of striking
the same.</p>

<p>Buster, too, strained his eyes in order to try
and supplement the good work; but George
contented himself with lolling there in a comfortable
position. What was the use, he doubtless
figured, of everybody getting excited? If
later on Josh wanted some one to “spell” him
George would be quite willing to assume the
responsibility; but he did not mean to wear out
his eyes when not on duty. And no doubt
George was quite right.</p>

<p>Things were going on so well that every one
felt much encouraged. Buster was even trying
to figure on what sort of speed they were making,
and where they would arrive if able to
keep on at this pace all through that night.</p>

<p>“Jack said it was about a hundred miles
down to the Iron Gate,” he told himself,
“where the river makes a turn and starts to
divide Serbia from Rumania. Wonder if we
could make half of that between now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
morning, and what would we do through the
day? I must ask Jack first chance I get if he
thinks it would be safe for us to keep on down
the river by daylight, with soldiers guarding
every mile of the banks and ordering us to
come ashore and explain who we are.”</p>

<p>Just then Buster gave a sudden start, for
Josh had whistled sharply. Jack instantly cut
off the power and then started to reverse the
engine so that their headway might be reduced
to next to nothing.</p>

<p>“Steady, Jack; we’re going to come alongside
a pontoon that seems to be partly filled
with water!” said Josh in a stage whisper.</p>

<p>He leaned still further over the bow, as
though bent upon reaching out to fend off from
the object that was floating like a derelict upon
the bosom of the great river.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it all right, fellows,” Josh continued
saying; “and would you believe it,
there’s a wounded man in the same! Guess
he’d have gone down in less’n ten minutes only
for our coming along.”</p>

<p>“What’s that you say, Josh?” asked Buster
eagerly, “a wounded man! How do you know
but what he’s dead?”</p>

<p>“Because he’s sitting up here,” came the
prompt reply.</p>

<p>Jack knew what that meant. They could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
leave a poor fellow badly injured to go down
with the leaking pontoon.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get him aboard here, that’s
flat!” said George, as though voicing what was
passing through the mind of each of his chums
just then.</p>

<p>Jack left the wheel and, passing along the
side of the boat, leaned over. Yes, there was a
man in the sinking pontoon. He did not appear
to know whether they would turn out to
be friends or foes; but his situation was desperate,
and upon seeing several heads appear
in view he commenced saying something in a
weak voice.</p>

<p>“That’s Magyar, of course,” remarked
George; “but the trouble is none of us can
translate a word of the same. However, that
doesn’t make any difference. Shall we help
him over the side, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Three of us can do the business, easy
enough,” responded the other.</p>

<p>When the Austrian engineer realized that
they meant him to leave his wretched float and
clamber into the motorboat, he lost no time in
starting to obey; though his actions quickly
told them he must be very weak, either through
loss of blood or from the shock of his wound.</p>

<p>Once he was deposited in the cabin, Jack sent
Josh again to the lookout, and himself started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the engine. The man had sunk upon the
cushioned seat as though quite content to take
things as he found them. He heard these unknown
parties speaking in what he must have
known was English, and was no doubt much
astonished. Just the main thing with him was
being rescued from the fate that had been
threatening him with a watery grave.</p>

<p>“Jack, he’s pretty badly hurt, I reckon,”
suggested George soon afterward.</p>

<p>“Well, something ought to be done for him,
that’s certain,” the skipper started to say.
“Do you think you could manage it, George?
I don’t want to give up the wheel, and Josh is
really needed forward there.”</p>

<p>George did not hesitate long. He guessed
that it might be anything but a pleasant task,
but then George had learned long ago not to
shrink because things were not always delightful.</p>

<p>“I’m willing to do the best I can, Jack,” he
said quickly.</p>

<p>“I knew you would, George, and there’s not
one of us can dress a wound better than you,
once you set your mind to the job. Get Buster
to help you, George.”</p>

<p>“Sure I will,” spoke up the stout chum,
“though I’m not clever at handling sick people,
and always shiver at sight of blood. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
you’ll need some kind of light to work by,
won’t you, George?”</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Jack. “You remember I’ve
got that little vest pocket electric torch. I’ve
been saving it because I’m afraid the battery
will soon run out. But this is just the time to
make use of it.”</p>

<p>He thereupon handed Buster the article in
question, a small nickeled affair not over three
inches in length. When the button was pressed
there came a shaft of light that was fairly
strong.</p>

<p>“Just the ticket, Jack,” announced George,
who was removing his coat with a business-like
air that quite tickled Buster, who thought
George already seemed to take on a professional
look.</p>

<p>They could now see that the man taken from
the sinking pontoon was a young Austrian soldier.
He had no marks on his uniform to
prove him anything save a private, but that
made no difference to the boys. They had seen
how those engineering corps men had taken
their lives in their hands in order to bridge the
Danube so that the artillery might be transported
across to the other bank, and had also
watched them going down by scores when that
furious fire burst out from the hidden Serbian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
trenches. On this account they must honor
him as a brave man.</p>

<p>He knew what George was about to do. Perhaps,
after all, taking off his coat was the sign
that made his intentions clear to one who could
not understand English very well.</p>

<p>Buster shut his teeth hard when the light
focussed on the man showed that one of his
arms was bloody. Still he did not quail, for
Buster could do a thing once he put his mind
to it.</p>

<p>George set to work. The Austrian soldier
understood that he was to help as well as he
could, and between them they managed to get
the water-soaked coat off. Then the sleeve of
his shirt was carefully rolled up, disclosing the
wound.</p>

<p>It was enough to make one with a stouter
heart than Buster shudder, for the cut was
severe, and had bled a great deal. From his
pack George took some linen bandages, without
which his mother would not have let him
leave home. He had other appliances in the
bargain, among which was surgeon’s adhesive
plaster, with which to keep the ends of bandages
in place.</p>

<p>First of all George proceeded to wash the
wound, Buster getting him some water from
the river in a tin basin they carried. After that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
he applied the soothing salve that was intended
to purify and take away some of the pain that
would be sure to follow on the morrow.</p>

<p>Jack glanced in every little while, and saw
that George was getting on splendidly, having
tied a tourniquet above the wound in order to
stop the bleeding. He was now engaged in
winding a bandage tightly around the arm in a
most professional way.</p>

<p>The man appeared to be very grateful. He
said something once in a while, but as none of
them could understand a word of Magyar they
had to guess at its meaning. Actions speak
louder than mere words, however, so they knew
that the patient appreciated their efforts in his
behalf, and that he was trying to tell them as
much.</p>

<p>Finally, to the great relief of Buster, the job
was done, and the man had his coat on again,
though that left sleeve hung empty at his side.</p>

<p>“And I want to say, George,” remarked
Buster, as he shut off the light and handed the
little pocket torch back to the owner, “that you
did the job up as neat as wax. If ever I have
the misfortune to get jabbed by a bullet I want
to engage you as the chief surgeon right now.
I’d feel myself in good hands, all right.”</p>

<p>Of course, this pleased George very much.
It was not so very often that he did anything to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
call for such fulsome praise; but he knew Buster
meant every word he uttered, because
Buster was candid and sincere.</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to wonder what will strike
us next,” George went on to say. “We are
sure neutral in this world war, because one day
we hold out a helping hand to a couple of young
Serbs in trouble, and right afterwards pick a
wounded Austrian out of a sinking pontoon
and look after his hurts.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the way it goes,” asserted Buster,
with a philosophical air. “You never can
tell what will happen, and especially when
there’s a silly old war on. We may run across
others who are clinging to fragments of that
bridge until we gather up a boatload.”</p>

<p>“Then there’d be nothing else for us to do
but run over to the Austrian side of the river
and land the whole bunch,” George told him.</p>

<p>Josh meanwhile had kept a good lookout.
Several times he sighted other pontoons and
floating planks, but as they did not happen to
be in the direct way of the motorboat he had
not given the warning whistle to cause Jack
to stop.</p>

<p>He had watched in every case to ascertain
whether there happened to be occupants to
these boats, but discovered none. If men had
floated away on them when the Serbian gun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
smashed the bridge, they must either have
made their way to the shore and been taken off
by search parties or else gone down into the
depths.</p>

<p>By degrees, however, these reminders of the
dreadful tragedy became fewer and fewer until
Josh failed to discover any more of them.
From this he decided that, owing to the increased
momentum attained for the motorboat
by the use of its engine, they had by this
time distanced all drifting snags. Still he
clung to his post until another ten minutes had
elapsed, when he came back to where Jack sat.</p>

<p>“We’ve got beyond all the floaters, Jack,”
he remarked, “and anyway my eyes begin to
feel the strain. So I thought I’d just drop in
and find out what your plan of campaign
might be.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean for to-night?” asked the pilot
at the wheel.</p>

<p>“Sure thing, Jack. We’re moving right now
at a healthy pace, but how long do you mean to
keep the same up, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>Jack took a look aloft. He found that the
same conditions prevailed there, with the heavens
covered with clouds so that the moon was
entirely shrouded from view.</p>

<p>“If things continued like that up there,” he
assured Josh, “I’d feel like keeping on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
move the whole night long. We’ll have to hide
somewhere in the daytime so as to keep from
getting into trouble; and perhaps to-morrow
night we can cover the balance of the distance
separating us from the Iron Gate.”</p>

<p>“But how will you be able to stand it?” demanded
Josh, indignantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can make up for lost sleep to-morrow,
you know; there’ll be really nothing else
to do the whole day long but sleep. And if I
find myself getting too dopey for any use, why,
I can call on George or you to take hold. It’s
all right, Josh, and please don’t waste any pity
on me. I’m only too glad to be able to cover
half that hundred miles before dawn comes
on.”</p>

<p>Josh knew better than to dispute Jack when
his mind was made up. Besides, that arrangement
just suited his own ideas.</p>

<p>George had been listening to this talk, also
Buster.</p>

<p>“I don’t call it fair for you to take all the
burden on your shoulders, Jack,” expostulated
the former; “especially when the rest of us are
willing to do our part.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so far as that goes, George,” he was
told, “you’re all under orders, you know; but
if I get tired I promise to call on you for
help.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>A HALF-WAY STOP</small></h2>


<p>Time passed, and the motorboat continued
to swing along with the current hour after
hour. Jack did not attempt to make great
speed. There was no necessity, and such a
move would be doubly dangerous, on account
of possible snags, and also discovery from the
shore.</p>

<p>In spite of their resolve to stay awake, Buster
and Josh and George seemed to be enjoying
a pretty healthy nap. The wounded stranger
also lay very quiet. Jack hoped he was not
in too great pain.</p>

<p>It was a long, dreary spell of duty for the
boy at the wheel. When finally George did
manage to awaken and, sitting up, asked Jack
if he meant to let him take a turn, he was considerably
astonished to hear the other say:</p>

<p>“I hardly think it would be worth while for
me to lie down just now, George, because, you
see, the night is nearly gone, and any minute
we may have to be turning in to the shore to
look for a cove where we can stay during the
day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>Both of them watched closely for an opening.
If the Danube was anything like the
rivers they were accustomed to in their home
land an occasional little bayou was likely to
occur, an indentation in the shore line where
possibly some creek emptied its waters into the
greater stream.</p>

<p>If only they could find some such a friendly
harbor it was Jack’s idea to push the motorboat
in and remain secreted during the entire
day. He had an idea that the region they were
now passing through was rather wild and not
settled very thickly, which fact was apt to
please them considerably.</p>

<p>Josh happened to wake up about this time
and wanted to know what was going on. When
he was told that morning was not far distant
he could hardly believe it until Jack asked him
to notice where the moon had gotten far over
in the west, for it was possible to locate the
heavenly luminary behind the clouds.</p>

<p>“All right, then,” he remarked, after George
had informed him what they were bent on doing,
“there’s your little crook in the shore just
ahead of us.”</p>

<p>“You’ve certainly got the eyes of a cat,
Josh,” George told him; “because it is what
we’re looking for, as sure as anything.”</p>

<p>Jack was already making use of the setting-pole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
to urge the motorboat toward the shore.
As the current proved very mild close in, he
did not have much difficulty in doing this.</p>

<p>They managed to enter the cove, for such it
proved to be. As far as they could see in the
wretched light it was surrounded by thickets
and lush grass.</p>

<p>“Just the sort of place we wanted to run
across,” remarked George; “and the celebrated
Stormways luck still holds good, it
seems.”</p>

<p>They soon had the boat fast to the bank. It
was then that Buster sat up and commenced
yawning at a terrific rate.</p>

<p>“Here, what’s going on out there?” he
asked cautiously. “Have we got fast on a
sandbar? Do you want any help pushing off?”</p>

<p>When he crawled out from the cabin he
stared around him as though he could not understand
it.</p>

<p>“What! gone ashore so soon, after all,
Jack?” he remarked reproachfully.</p>

<p>“So soon?” echoed Josh. “Why, do you
know it’s nearly morning, boy? All of us just
slept like logs and let Jack do the work. I feel
like kicking myself, that’s what.”</p>

<p>“Let me do it for you then, Josh?” asked
Buster. “It’ll help wake me up good and
plenty, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you, but I’m capable of doing my
own kicking most of the time. But Jack, now
that we’ve landed, you get in under the shelter
and make yourself comfortable right away.
We’ll wake you up later on when we’ve got
breakfast ready.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, sure we will,” added Buster
vehemently, though he looked disappointed because
Josh placed such little confidence in him.</p>

<p>“Of course, I needn’t ask you fellows to look
out for our passenger,” remarked Jack. “He
seemed to sleep a part of the time, though I
heard him groaning once or twice, poor chap.
Be sure to cook enough breakfast for an extra
boarder when you’re about it, Buster.”</p>

<p>With that Jack consented to lie down. He
was asleep before five minutes went by, being
fairly well exhausted. When they aroused
him two hours later it was long since full day.
The clouds, too, were breaking overhead, promising
fair weather, a fact that pleased them all
very much.</p>

<p>Breakfast was ready, and the odors gave
promise of an appetizing meal. Jack discovered
that George had looked again at the arm
of the injured Austrian, though not removing
the bandage, as everything seemed to be getting
along nicely. The man appeared to be
rather cheerful. He could say a few words of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
English, and managed to understand that they
were American boys to whom he found himself
indebted perhaps for his very life, certainly
for the many comforts he was now enjoying.</p>

<p>After they had partaken of breakfast and
satisfied their keen appetites, the boys sat
around and talked in low tones. Josh, while
Buster was getting the meal, had gone ashore
and roamed around a little. He reported that
so far as he could see the place was quite
lonely.</p>

<p>“I discovered the house of a Serb peasant,”
he explained. “There are only an old man and
woman home, as their boys have been called to
the colors to fight. They seem to be well disposed
and can speak some English. I told
them who we were and what we were doing on
the river. I also took pains to speak of the
Serbian boy and girl we helped get through the
lower part of Austria and landed near Belgrade.
They say we are all of fifty miles away
from the capital now.”</p>

<p>“I figured we must have covered something
like that last night,” said Jack confidently;
“and another similar turn would take us to
where we would have no need of feeling worried.
I was thinking that perhaps we might
influence this couple to take our patient off our
hands and keep him until he can get across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
river again. A couple of dollars would be
something worth while to them, you know.”</p>

<p>“We’ll try it, anyhow,” ventured Josh.
“Another thing, fellows; I bargained with
them to have a chicken killed and dressed for
our dinner. If we do have to hold over here,
there’s no reason why we should go on half
rations.”</p>

<p>As the morning advanced they began to hear
the far distant sound of heavy firing again.
This, of course, held their attention more or
less, for they had come to take a personal interest
in the warfare between the would-be invaders
and the gallant Serbs, who stood ready
to defend their shore from attack.</p>

<p>Not feeling just like lying down again, Jack
accompanied Josh over to the humble cabin
home of the old peasants. They managed to
talk with them, partly through the sign language,
by means of which so much can be exchanged
between two people neither of whom
can speak the other’s tongue.</p>

<p>Jack found that the old people were not at
all bitter toward Austrians as citizens, their
resentment being only for those in high places,
who they believed desired the ultimate annexation
of all Serbia in order to link the Teutonic
races with Turkey and the East, where Germany
believed the star of destiny was drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
her, with the rich booty of India in her eye.</p>

<p>They readily agreed to care for the wounded
engineer corps man until such time as he could
get across the river again to his own country.
Later in the day the boys brought the Austrian
to the cabin and saw him installed there.
George had made a stout sling for his wounded
arm, and on the whole the man felt that these
young Americans had treated him splendidly.</p>

<p>So they had again “cleared the decks,” as
Josh put it. First the Serb brother and sister,
and next the injured bridge-builder who had
been swept away in that hurricane of fire when
the concealed Serbs smashed the pontoon
structure.</p>

<p>All they meant to wait for now was the coming
of night. They could eat an early dinner,
for Buster had that fowl all cut up and ready
for the frying pan. With the coming of darkness
after the gloaming they meant to start
forth, take the middle of the river, and make
as fast time as the conditions warranted.</p>

<p>All of them were glad to see the sun sinking
toward the western hills. During the afternoon
there had been no vigorous firing in the
distance, though once in a while they would
catch a faint boom. It was just as though the
contestants wanted each other to know they
were still watchfully waiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>No doubt the Austrians would have other
plans to try and carry out. Because the first
pontoon bridge had been wrecked was no reason
they would not exert themselves to effect a
crossing. History tells us that in the end they
did succeed in transporting an army to Serbia,
and for some time pressed the men of the valiant
old King Peter back along the valley of the
Morava; but once among the hills and wilder
country so suited to their style of fighting, the
Serbs, with the old king at their head, struck
heavy blows that brought consternation upon
their enemies. In the end the Austrians were
compelled to begin a retreat that savored almost
of a rout, so that for months afterwards
not a single invader remained on Serbian territory.</p>

<p>Buster had supper ready on time, and it was
a royal feast. He had gone ashore to where the
obliging Josh had built a splendid cooking fire,
and here Buster had an opportunity to spread
himself.</p>

<p>By the time supper had been finished and
everything cleaned up it was beginning to actually
grow dark. Jack was keeping track of the
time, and also of the attendant conditions.</p>

<p>“We ought to leave here in ten minutes or
so,” he said. “The moon, being some past the
full, isn’t to be looked for until about nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
o’clock or later to-night. That’s going to give
us an hour and more of darkness to make our
first run. After that we’ll have to take Hobson’s
choice.”</p>

<p>“The moon is going to shine bright enough,”
observed Josh; “but as the river is getting
pretty wide down here, and we can keep to the
middle, it’s small chance of our being seen
from ashore. Besides, there are few soldiers
around this part of the country, the old man
said.”</p>

<p>When the ten minutes mentioned by Jack
had passed the word was given, and once more
the motorboat began descending the dark waters
of the Danube.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>CONSTANTINOPLE AT LAST&mdash;CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p>That was another night of constant watchfulness.
Some one would have to be on duty
every minute of the time they were in motion,
to handle the wheel and keep the motorboat as
near the middle of the big river as possible.</p>

<p>The moon shone brightly at times, and again
hid her face behind friendly clouds. But they
were at a good distance from either shore, and
objects even in the full of the moon are never
distinct. A peculiar little haze, too, hung over
the water, making things seem very romantic,
and helping Jack and his chums wonderfully.</p>

<p>Jack changed his plan of campaign on this
second night. He decided to sit out the first
hour or two and then resign in favor of George,
who in turn might be followed by Josh, though
the last mentioned was not as much of a skipper
as the occasion called for.</p>

<p>The worst of the danger Jack believed was
past. It lay in that quarter where the Austrians
had expected to force a passage of the
Danube by means of a pontoon bridge, over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
which, their heavy guns could be taken. There
would undoubtedly be more or less peril all
along the border, for not a mile but would have
its watchers, eager to report any activity on
the other side. Still Jack hoped to pass almost
unnoticed, if fortune were kind.</p>

<p>This programme then was carried out,
George being put in charge of the wheel about
ten o’clock, with orders to call the skipper if
anything suspicious came to pass. This might
consist of any one of a dozen different things;
and George felt that his honor was at stake
when he took command of the expedition, so it
could easily be understood he was wide awake.</p>

<p>Just two hours afterwards Jack sat up. He
had been sound asleep all that time, and, considerably
to the surprise of the wheelsman,
awoke at the very time he said he would.</p>

<p>They sat and chatted in low tones for a long
time. Nothing happened to alarm them, and
the boat kept constantly descending the widening
Danube. At times the shores came closer
together as the country assumed a wilder aspect,
with mountains bordering the romantic
looking stream. Occasionally they could see
dim lights on one side or the other, which would
indicate that they were passing some village or
town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>It was well toward morning when Jack
awoke the others. Long before this George,
who had been yawning tremendously, decided
that it was unnecessary for him to try and sit
Jack out. If the skipper were bent on keeping
the wheel constantly, what was the need of any
one else losing their full quota of sleep? And
so George had lain down again, though protesting
to the last that he didn’t think it quite
fair.</p>

<p>When Jack awoke them it was with a word
of caution.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to the Iron Gate, fellows,” was
what he told them, “and I thought you would
be sorry if you didn’t have a chance to see for
yourselves. Besides, there’s more or less danger
for us in the next half hour, so I concluded
you ought to be on deck. No talking now,
please, but watchful waiting.”</p>

<p>They sat there and counted the minutes as
the boat passed between what seemed like high
bluffs. George could easily understand now
why the place was called the Iron Gate. Bulgaria’s
nearest border lay only thirty miles
away, but the intervening country was so
rocky and wild that an army would have a
frightful time trying to force its way across
the strip, especially when such valiant fighters
as the Serbians manned the heights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing happened, however, and later on
Jack calmly announced that they had made the
turn in safety upon which so much depended.</p>

<p>Instead of Austria, they now had Rumania
on their left, and as that country was at peace
with Serbia, there was little occasion for believing
the shores would be manned by troops
or batteries.</p>

<p>Jack consented to go and lie down as the
faint streaks of coming dawn began to appear
in the east. He had been under a heavy strain,
although his manner was so cheerful that one
would never suspect it; and he certainly needed
a good long rest.</p>

<p>They did not wake him up for breakfast,
acting on his orders. This frugal meal Buster
prepared while they were going at full speed
down the constantly widening river.</p>

<p>So the morning passed. At noon Jack made
his appearance and announced that he felt like
a new man again. George, who had been skipper
for the time being, refused to resign his
post of honor until dinner time had come and
gone. Tired of being on board, they found a
good retired place and went ashore to prepare
this meal, as well as “loaf” for an hour or two
in the heat of the day.</p>

<p>Long before night came on they had left turbulent
Serbia far behind and found themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
running between Bulgaria and Rumania.</p>

<p>Two days later found them at the bustling
Bulgarian river city of Rustchuk, and here
they rested for fully twenty-four hours, laying
in a few more stores and trying to learn something
of the great events that were happening
in other parts of Europe.</p>

<p>It was here they heard that the Belgians had
stood like a stone wall in front of the Kaiser’s
legions, ten times their strength, delaying the
advance for days at terrible cost to themselves,
so that possibly the German hosts might find
their long arranged plan for taking Paris
nipped in the bud.</p>

<p>The boys also learned of other great events,
beginning with the news that Great Britain
was now at war with the Teuton allies, together
with word of a Russian advance into East
Prussia.</p>

<p>All these things interested them intensely.
Being right there on the ground, and having
lately actually been in the whirlpool of the war,
they could understand and appreciate the tremendous
nature of the world-wide struggle
much better than any of their friends, who
were separated from the theatre of conflict by
thousands of miles and could read of battles
without a thrill.</p>

<p>The voyage was resumed after a time spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
in the Bulgarian city, and presently they
found themselves headed almost due north,
such are the vagaries of the wonderful blue
Danube in its long journey from the northern
border of Switzerland all the way to the Black
Sea.</p>

<p>They were now in Rumania proper, and four
days later arrived at the important city of
Galatz. Here they expected to say good-by to
the motorboat that had served them so well on
their long and eventful trip. Arrangements
had been made for turning the same over to a
certain dealer, who was instructed to repay
Jack the amount of security the boys had been
compelled to put up against possible loss of the
chartered craft.</p>

<p>Two days later they took passage on a small
steamer that was bound for Constantinople.
They made the passage of the lower Danube by
daylight, so it was possible for them to see
every phase of the wonderful river before it
was wedded to the famous Black Sea.</p>

<p>It took them the better part of a week to
reach their port, for the steamer was what
might be called a coasting trader, stopping
at numerous towns on the Bulgarian
and Rumanian shores for half a day at a
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless the boys enjoyed it immensely,
though one night a little storm did come along
and give Buster quite a scare. Fortunately, it
died down before any damage had been done,
though showing them how savage a sea could
arise in short order in this inland body of
water.</p>

<p>Finally they reached the entrance to the
Bosphorus, and found themselves passing
along a narrow stretch of water that filled them
with delight. It was bordered with green
groves, white buildings of rich Turks, occasional
fortresses, and in places arose the domes
of magnificent mosques, with their accompanying
minarets, where at certain hours the <i>meuzzen’s</i>
loud call to prayer could be heard, summoning
the faithful Mahometans to worship.</p>

<p>Then came Constantinople, where they
meant to spend several days before starting for
London <i>via</i> Italy.</p>

<p>Here they had the time of their lives, prying
into all sorts of strange places, and seeing just
how the red-fezzed Turks lived. All of them
enjoyed it to the full, and no doubt laid up a
treasure of recollections that would haunt
them the balance of their lives.</p>

<p>Buster was wild to see the inside of a mosque
the first thing, and managed to accomplish it
with his mates, though all of them had to remove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
their shoes and put on ridiculous red
slippers without heels, for the sacred interior
of the temple would be profaned if shoes were
worn.</p>

<p>Josh had gotten it in his head that he would
love to see what a harem looked like, and came
near getting into serious difficulty in pursuing
this fad; but he never reached his goal, and had
to give it up.</p>

<p>All the same, the boys looked upon a myriad
of strange sights, such as they had read about
in books like the Arabian Nights, but never
really expected to see with their own eyes.</p>

<p>Jack noticed that there were a great many
Germans in Constantinople, and he expressed
the opinion that sooner or later he believed
Turkey would align herself with the Teuton
powers against her old-time friends and backers,
Great Britain and France. His prediction
was later on fulfilled, as events proved, and
eventually Turkey took the mad plunge into
war at the behest of her master, Germany, to
submit her last slender grip on European territory
to the test of the sword.</p>

<p>Here in the wonderful city on the Golden
Horn we will say good-by to the four Motorboat
Boys. They fully expected to start for
Italy in two days, and were now only filling in
the time waiting for a certain steamship to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
arrive that would convey them through the Sea
of Marmora, along the historical Dardanelles
into the Ægean Sea, and finally to Naples,
where they could at their pleasure sail for
London and home.</p>

<p>No doubt our adventurous young friends,
whose fortunes we have followed with so much
pleasure in this and previous volumes, are
bound to meet with further stirring experiences,
which in due time we shall hope to lay
before the reader. Until that time arrives we
shall have to drop the curtain and write the
words</p>
